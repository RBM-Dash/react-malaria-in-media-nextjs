# Unveiling Global Health Insights: Your Multilingual, Multi-Region Malaria Dashboard

Navigate the complex landscape of malaria news and research across diverse languages and regions with unparalleled clarity. This dashboard empowers you with real-time, localized intelligence, breaking down geographical and linguistic barriers to understanding. Discover how we bring you comprehensive, actionable insights from every corner of the globe.

## How the Dashboard Operates

This interactive dashboard serves as a dynamic hub for malaria-related information, offering a streamlined way to access and analyze global trends. It provides a centralized view of news articles, scientific research, and key performance indicators (KPIs) related to malaria. Users can effortlessly filter content by various criteria, including content type (general news or scientific research), specific continents, and relevant search terms. This robust filtering capability ensures a highly tailored experience, allowing you to focus on the information most pertinent to your interests. The dashboard's intuitive interface, built with modern web technologies like React and Next.js, guarantees a smooth, responsive, and engaging user experience across all devices.

## Interactive Features: Filtering and Searching

The dashboard is equipped with powerful interactive features that allow you to refine the content and quickly find the information that matters most to you.

### Content Filters

Located just below the main header, the content filter tabs allow you to switch between different views of the data:

*   **News**: Displays general news articles. This is the default view.
*   **Scientific**: Shows research-oriented articles, primarily from sources like PubMed.
*   **Africa, Latin America, Caribbean, Asia, North America, Europe**: These tabs filter the articles to show only those originating from the selected continent.
*   **All Content**: Removes all filters and displays every article in the database.

### Language Translation

To the right of the content filters, you'll find the translation buttons. You can instantly translate the titles and descriptions of all visible articles into:

*   **EN** (English)
*   **FR** (French)
*   **PT** (Portuguese)
*   **ES** (Spanish)

The dashboard will remember your language preference as you switch between different content filters.

### Multi-Lingual Search

A powerful, multi-lingual search bar is available in the header. You can use this to find articles containing specific keywords. The search is designed to be comprehensive and will look for your search term in the following fields:

*   The article's original title and description.
*   The English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese translations of the title and description.
*   The detected country of the article.

This allows you to search for a term in one language and find relevant articles that may have been originally published in another, breaking down language barriers in your research.
