Reported cholera cases rose by 5% and deaths by 50% in 2024 compared to 2023, with more than 6000 people dying from a disease that is both preventable and treatable.",
  "content": "&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has published its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-wer-10036-347-364&quot;&gt;global cholera statistics for 2024&lt;/a&gt;, showing an increase in both the number of people who fell sick and died from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reported cholera cases rose by 5% and deaths by 50% in 2024 compared to 2023, with more than 6000 people dying from a disease that is both preventable and treatable. While these numbers are themselves alarming, they are underestimates of the true burden of cholera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conflict, climate change, population displacement, and long-term deficiencies in water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure continue to fuel the rise of cholera, a disease caused by the bacterium, &lt;em&gt;Vibrio cholerae,&lt;/em&gt; which spreads rapidly through faeces-contaminated water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty countries reported cases in 2024, an increase from 45 in 2023. The burden of the disease remained concentrated in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, which collectively accounted for 98% of all reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scope of cholera outbreaks continued to expand in 2024, with 12 countries each reporting more than 10&amp;nbsp;000 cases, seven of which experiencing large outbreaks for the first time in the year. The resurgence of cholera in Comoros after more than 15 years without reported outbreaks, underscores the persistent threat of global transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case fatality ratio for Africa increased from 1.4% in 2023 to 1.9% in 2024, revealing critical gaps in the delivery of life-saving care, and signaling the fragility of many health systems, along with challenges in access to basic health services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One quarter of deaths occurred in the community, outside of health facilities, highlighting serious gaps in access to treatment and the need to strengthen work with communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat cholera, governments, donors and communities need to ensure people have access to safe water and hygiene facilities, have accurate information on how to protect themselves, and rapid access to treatment and vaccination when there are outbreaks. Strong surveillance and diagnostics will help guide these responses. Further investment in vaccine production is also needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new, innovative oral cholera vaccine (OCV), Euvichol-S&amp;reg;, was prequalified in early 2024 and entered the global stockpile. Its addition helped to maintain average stockpile levels above the emergency threshold of 5 million doses for the first 6 months of 2025. However, due to the continued high demand for OCV, the temporary change from a two-dose to a single-dose regimen remained in effect throughout 2024 and into 2025. Requests for 61&amp;nbsp;million OCV doses were made to the global stockpile in 2024, and a record 40&amp;nbsp;million were approved for emergency use in reactive, single-dose campaigns in 16 countries. However, supply constraints continued to outstrip demand in 2024, and into 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary data show that the global cholera crisis continues into 2025, with 31 countries reporting outbreaks since the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO assesses the global risk from cholera as very high, and is responding with urgency to reduce deaths and contain outbreaks in countries around the world. WHO continues to support countries through strengthened public health surveillance, case management, and prevention measures; provision of essential medical supplies; coordination of field deployments with partners; and support for risk communication and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

As part of broader efforts to reduce inequities in cancer care, the Committee recommended increasing access to PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, a class of immunotherapy medicines that help the body’s immune system recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. Pembrolizumab was added to the EML as a first-line monotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

The Committee emphasized that while health system reforms require time and government action, clinical strategies can be implemented immediately to deliver faster benefits, especially in resource-limited settings. </p>\n<h2>Medicines for diabetes and obesity</h2>\n<p>Diabetes and obesity are two of the most urgent health challenges facing the world today. Over 800 million people were living with diabetes in 2022, with half going untreated. At the same time, more than 1 billion people worldwide are affected by obesity, and rates are rising especially fast in low- and middle-income countries. These two conditions are closely linked and can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease and kidney failure.</p>\n<p>The WHO Expert Committee reviewed strong scientific evidence showing that a group of medicines called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists can help people with type 2 diabetes – especially those who also have heart or kidney disease – by improving blood sugar control, reducing the risk of heart and kidney complications, supporting weight loss, and even lowering the risk of early death. </p>\n<p>GLP-1 receptor agonists – semaglutide, dulaglutide and liraglutide – and the GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) dual receptor agonist (tirzepatide) have been added to the EML. They are used as glucose lowering therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease and obesity (defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30kg/m<sup>2</sup>). This provides clear guidance to countries on which patients can benefit most from these therapies.</p>\n<p>High prices of medicines like semaglutide and tirzepatide are limiting access to these medicines. Prioritizing those who would benefit most, encouraging generic competition to drive down prices and making these treatments available in primary care – especially in underserved areas – are key to expanding access and improving health outcomes. WHO will continue monitoring developments, support fair pricing strategies, and help countries improve access to these life-changing treatments.</p>\n<p>“A large share of out-of-pocket spending on noncommunicable diseases goes toward medicines, including those classified as essential and that, in principle, should be financially accessible to everyone,” said Deusdedit Mubangizi, WHO Director of Policy and Standards for Medicines and Health Products. “Achieving equitable access to essential medicines requires a coherent health system response backed by strong political will, multisectoral cooperation, and people-centred programmes that leave no one behind.”</p>\n<p>More details of the Expert Committee’s recommendations, describing the additions, changes and removal of medicines and formulations, and decisions not to recommend medicines are available in the Executive Summary <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/B09544\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note to editors</strong></p>\n<p>The meeting of the 25th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines was held at WHO Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, from 5 to 9 May 2025.

The new findings published in two reports – World mental health today and Mental Health Atlas 2024 – highlight some areas of progress while exposing significant gaps in addressing mental health conditions worldwide.",
  "content": "&lt;p&gt;More than 1 billion people are living with mental health disorders, according to new data released by the World Health Organization (WHO), with conditions such as anxiety and depression inflicting immense human and economic tolls. While many countries have bolstered their mental health policies and programmes, greater investment and action are needed globally to scale up services to protect and promote people&amp;rsquo;s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression are highly prevalent in all countries and communities, affecting people of all ages and income levels. They represent the second biggest reason for long-term disability, contributing to loss of healthy life. They drive up health-care costs for affected people and families while inflicting substantial economic losses on a global scale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings published in two reports &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/382343/9789240113817-eng.pdf&quot;&gt;World mental health today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/382452/9789240114487-eng.pdf&quot;&gt;Mental Health Atlas 2024&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash; highlight some areas of progress while exposing significant gaps in addressing mental health conditions worldwide. The reports serve as critical tools to inform national strategies and shape global dialogue ahead of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/teams/noncommunicable-diseases/on-the-road-to-2025&quot;&gt;2025 United Nations High-Level Meeting on noncommunicable diseases and promotion of mental health and well-being&lt;/a&gt;, taking place in New York on 25 September 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Transforming mental health services is one of the most pressing public health challenges,&amp;rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &quot;Investing in mental health means investing in people, communities, and economies &amp;ndash; an investment no country can afford to neglect. Every government and every leader has a responsibility to act with urgency and to ensure that mental health care is treated not as a privilege, but as a basic right for all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key data from &lt;em&gt;World mental health today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report shows that while prevalence of mental health disorders can vary by sex, women are disproportionately impacted overall. Anxiety and depressive disorders are the most common types of mental health disorders among both men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suicide remains a devastating outcome, claiming an estimated 727 000 lives in 2021 alone. It is a leading cause of death among young people across all countries and socioeconomic contexts. Despite global efforts, progress in reducing suicide mortality is too low to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of a one-third reduction in suicide rates by 2030. On the current trajectory, only a 12% reduction will be achieved by that deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic impact of mental health disorders is staggering. While health-care costs are substantial, the indirect costs&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash; particularly in lost productivity&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash; are far greater. Depression and anxiety alone cost the global economy an estimated US$ 1 trillion each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings underscore the urgent need for sustained investment, stronger prioritization, and multi-sectoral collaboration to expand access to mental health care, reduce stigma, and tackle the root causes of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key findings from the &lt;em&gt;2024 Mental Health Atlas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2020, countries have been making significant strides in strengthening their mental health policies and planning. Many have updated their policies, adopted rights-based approaches, and enhanced preparedness for mental health and psychosocial support during health emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this momentum has not translated into legal reform. Fewer countries have adopted or enforced rights-based mental health legislation, and only 45% of countries evaluated laws in full compliance with international human rights standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report reveals a concerning stagnation in mental health investment. Median government spending on mental health remains at just 2% of total health budgets &amp;ndash; unchanged since 2017. Disparities between countries are stark; while high-income countries spend up to US$ 65 per person on mental health, low-income countries spend as little as US$ 0.04. The global median number of mental health workers stands at 13 per 100 000 people, with extreme shortages in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reform and development of mental health services is progressing slowly. Fewer than 10% of countries have fully transitioned to community-based care models, with most countries still in the early stages of transition. Inpatient care continues to rely heavily on psychiatric hospitals, with nearly half of admissions occurring involuntarily and over 20% lasting longer than a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integration of mental health into primary care is advancing, with 71% of countries meeting at least three of five WHO criteria. However, data gaps remain; only 22 countries provided sufficient data to estimate service coverage for psychosis. In low-income countries fewer than 10% of affected individuals receive care, compared to over 50% in higher-income nations &amp;ndash; highlighting an urgent need to expand access and strengthen service delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouragingly, most countries report having functional mental health promotion initiatives such as early childhood development, school-based mental health and suicide prevention programmes. Over 80% of countries now offer mental health and psychosocial support as part of emergency responses, up from 39% in 2020. Outpatient mental health services and telehealth are becoming more available, though access remains uneven. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Global call to scale up action on mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there have been some encouraging developments, the latest data shows that countries remain far off track to achieve the targets set in WHO&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240031029&quot;&gt;Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO calls on governments and global partners to urgently intensify efforts toward systemic transformation of mental health systems worldwide. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;li data-list=&quot;0&quot; data-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;equitable financing of mental health services;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list=&quot;0&quot; data-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;legal and policy reform to uphold human rights;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list=&quot;0&quot; data-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;sustained investment in the mental health workforce; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list=&quot;0&quot; data-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;expansion of community-based, person-centered care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Note for editors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/382343/9789240113817-eng.pdf&quot;&gt;World mental health today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; publication is a timely update to the data chapter of the 2022 World Mental Health Report: Transforming Mental Health for All. As mental health transformation continues to be needed worldwide, this latest release brings together the most up-to-date global data on the prevalence, burden, and economic cost of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/382452/9789240114487-eng.pdf&quot;&gt;Mental Health Atlas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; survey assesses the state of mental health services and systems across the world. This latest edition compiles findings from 144 countries and provides the most comprehensive representation of the world&amp;rsquo;s response to the challenge of mental ill-health through implementation of mental health policies, legislation, financing, human resources, availability and utilization of services and data collection systems. This latest edition includes new sections on tele mental health and mental health and psychosocial support preparedness and response in emergencies, which reflect the changing landscape of mental health and associated data gaps or information needs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

  "content": "&lt;p&gt;More than half a million people in Gaza are trapped in famine, marked by widespread starvation, destitution and preventable deaths, according to a new    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Famine_Review_Committee_Report_Gaza_Aug2025.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;released today. Famine conditions are projected to spread from Gaza Governorate to Deir Al Balah and Khan Younis Governorates in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), UNICEF, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have collectively and consistently highlighted the extreme urgency for an immediate and full-scale humanitarian response given the escalating hunger-related deaths, rapidly worsening levels of acute malnutrition and plummeting levels of food consumption, with hundreds of thousands of people going days without anything to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agencies reinforced that famine must be stopped at all costs. An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict is critical to allow unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response that can save lives. The agencies are also gravely concerned about the threat of an intensified military offensive in Gaza City and any escalation in the conflict, as it would have further devastating consequences for civilians where famine conditions already exist. Many people &amp;ndash; especially sick and malnourished children, older people and people with disabilities &amp;ndash; may be unable to evacuate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of September, more than 640&amp;nbsp;000 people will face Catastrophic levels of food insecurity &amp;ndash; classified as IPC Phase 5 &amp;ndash; across the Gaza Strip. An additional 1.14&amp;nbsp;million people in the territory will be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and a further 396&amp;nbsp;000 people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) conditions. Conditions in North Gaza are estimated to be as severe &amp;ndash; or worse &amp;ndash; than in Gaza City. However, limited data prevented an IPC classification, highlighting the urgent need for access to assess and assist. Rafah was not analyzed given indications that it is largely depopulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classifying famine means that the most extreme category is triggered when three critical thresholds &amp;ndash; extreme food deprivation, acute malnutrition and starvation-related deaths &amp;ndash; have been breached. The latest analysis now affirms on the basis of reasonable evidence that these criteria have been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost two years of conflict, repeated displacement, and severe restrictions on humanitarian access, compounded by repeated interruptions and impediments to access to food, water, medical aid, support to agriculture, livestock and fisheries and the collapse of health, sanitation, and market systems, have pushed people into starvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to food in Gaza remains severely constrained. In July, the number of households reporting very severe hunger doubled across the territory compared to May and more than tripled in Gaza City. More than one in three people (39 percent) indicated they were going days at a time without eating, and adults regularly skip meals to feed their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malnutrition among children in Gaza is accelerating at a catastrophic pace. In July alone, more than 12&amp;nbsp;000 children were identified as acutely malnourished &amp;ndash; the highest monthly figure ever recorded and a six-fold increase since the start of the year. Nearly one in four of these children were suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM), the deadliest form with both short and long-term impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the last IPC Analysis in May, the number of children expected to be at severe risk of death from malnutrition by the end of June 2026 has tripled from 14&amp;nbsp;100 to 43&amp;nbsp;400. Similarly, for pregnant and breastfeeding women, the number of estimated cases has tripled from 17&amp;nbsp;000 in May to 55&amp;nbsp;000 women expected to be suffering from perilous levels of malnutrition by mid-2026. The impact is visible: one in five babies are born prematurely or underweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new assessment reports the most severe deterioration since the IPC began analyzing acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, and it marks the first time a famine has been officially confirmed in the Middle East region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since July, food and aid supplies entering Gaza increased slightly but remained vastly insufficient, inconsistent and inaccessible compared to the need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, approximately 98 percent of cropland in the territory is damaged or inaccessible &amp;ndash; decimating the agriculture sector and local food production &amp;ndash; and nine of ten people have been serially displaced from homes. Cash is critically scarce, aid operations remain severely disrupted, with most UN trucks looted amid growing desperation. Food prices are extremely high and there are not enough fuel and water to cook and medicines and medical supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaza&amp;rsquo;s health system has severely deteriorated, access to safe drinking water and sanitation services has been drastically reduced, while multi-drug resistant infections are surging and levels of morbidity &amp;ndash; including diarrhoea, fever, acute respiratory and skin infections &amp;ndash; are alarmingly high among children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable lifesaving humanitarian operations, the U.N. agencies emphasized the importance of an immediate and sustained ceasefire to stop the killing, allow for the safe release of hostages and permit unimpeded access for a mass influx of assistance to reach people across Gaza. They stressed the urgent need for greater amounts of food aid, along with dramatically improved delivery, distribution and accessibility, as well as shelter, fuel, cooking gas and food production inputs. They emphasized that it is critical to support the rehabilitation of the health system, maintain and revive essential health services, including primary health care, and ensure sustained delivery of health supplies into and across Gaza. The restoration of commercial flows at scale, market systems, essential services, and local food production is also vital if the worst outcomes of the famine are to be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People in Gaza have exhausted every possible means of survival. Hunger and malnutrition are claiming lives every day, and the destruction of cropland, livestock, greenhouses, fishery and food production systems has made the situation even more dire,&amp;rdquo; said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu. &amp;ldquo;Our priority must now be safe and sustained access for large-scale food assistance. Access to food is not a privilege &amp;ndash; it is a basic human right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Famine warnings have been clear for months,&amp;rdquo; said Cindy McCain, WFP Executive Director. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s urgently needed now is a surge of aid, safer conditions, and proven distribution systems to reach those most in need &amp;ndash; wherever they are. Full humanitarian access and a ceasefire now are critical to save lives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Famine is now a grim reality for children in Gaza Governorate, and a looming threat in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis,&amp;rdquo; said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. &amp;ldquo;As we have repeatedly warned, the signs were unmistakable: children with wasted bodies, too weak to cry or eat; babies dying from hunger and preventable disease; parents arriving at clinics with nothing left to feed their children. There is no time to lose. Without an immediate ceasefire and full humanitarian access, famine will spread, and more children will die.&amp;nbsp;Children on the brink of starvation need the special therapeutic feeding that UNICEF provides.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative now,&amp;rdquo; said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. &amp;ldquo;The world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine. Widespread malnutrition means that even common and usually mild diseases like diarrhoea are becoming fatal, especially for children. The health system, run by hungry and exhausted health workers, cannot cope. Gaza must be urgently supplied with food and medicines to save lives and begin the process of reversing malnutrition. Hospitals must be protected so that they can continue treating patients. Aid blockages must end, and peace must be restored, so that healing can begin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Notes for editors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access the IPC alert &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Famine_Review_Committee_Report_Gaza_Aug2025.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is an innovative 21-partner initiative &amp;ndash; made up of UN agencies and international NGOs &amp;ndash; for improving food security and nutrition analysis and decision-making.

This guidance builds on five decades of research and responds to the record-breaking temperatures of recent years, with 2023 being the hottest year on record.",
  "content": "&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) have published a new joint report and guidance highlighting the growing global health challenges posed by extreme heat on workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As climate change drives more frequent and intense heatwaves, many workers who are regularly exposed to dangerous heat conditions are already feeling the health impacts of rising temperatures, in particular, manual workers in sectors such as agriculture, construction and fisheries. Increasing heat episodes are also leading to health issues for vulnerable populations in developing countries, such as children, older adults and low-income populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Heat stress is already harming the health and livelihoods of billions of workers, especially in the most vulnerable communities,&amp;rdquo; said Dr Jeremy Farrar, WHO Assistant Director-General, Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Care. &amp;ldquo;This new guidance offers practical, evidence-based solutions to protect lives, reduce inequality, and build more resilient workforces in a warming world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new report and technical guidance, entitled Climate change and workplace heat stress draws on five decades of research and evidence, highlighting that the health and productivity of workers are severely impacted by rising temperatures. WMO reports that 2024 was the hottest year on record. Daytime temperatures of more than 40&amp;deg;C and even above 50&amp;deg;C are becoming increasingly common, a clear indication that immediate action is needed to address the worsening impact of heat stress on workers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Occupational heat stress has become a global societal challenge, which is no longer confined to countries located close to equator &amp;ndash; as highlighted by the recent heatwave in Europe,&amp;rdquo; said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett. &amp;ldquo;Protection of workers from extreme heat is not just a health imperative but an economic necessity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report and guidance outline key issues related with health impacts of extreme heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The frequency and intensity of extreme heat events have risen sharply, increasing risks for both outdoor and indoor workers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worker productivity drops by 2&amp;ndash;3% for every degree above 20&amp;deg;C.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health risks include heatstroke, dehydration, kidney dysfunction, and neurological disorders, all of which hinder long-term health and economic security.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Approximately half the global population suffers adverse consequences of high temperatures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle these challenges, the report calls for the implementation of occupational heat action plans, tailored to specific industries and regions, and developed in collaboration with employers, workers, unions, and public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recommended actions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidance lays out a clear path for governments, employers, and health authorities to mitigate the growing risks of extreme heat on working populations. The recommended actions include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop occupational heat-health policies&lt;/strong&gt; with tailored plans and advisories that consider local weather patterns, specific jobs, and worker vulnerabilities;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on vulnerable populations&lt;/strong&gt; with special attention given to middle-aged and older workers, individuals with chronic health conditions, and those with lower physical fitness who can be more susceptible to the effects of heat stress;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education and awareness raising&lt;/strong&gt; for first responders, health professionals, employers, and workers to recognize and properly treat heat stress symptoms, which are often misdiagnosed;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage all stakeholders&lt;/strong&gt; from workers and trade unions to health experts and local authorities in the co-creation of heat-health strategies that are locally relevant and widely supported.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design solutions&lt;/strong&gt; that are not only effective but also practical, affordable and environmentally sustainable, ensuring policies can be implemented at scale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace innovation&lt;/strong&gt; by adopting technologies that can help safeguard health while maintaining productivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support further research and evaluation&lt;/strong&gt; to strengthen the effectiveness of occupational heat-health measures and ensure maximum protection for workers worldwide.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report and technical guidance by WHO and WMO complement the findings of the recent International Labour Organization (ILO) reports which highlight that more than 2.4&amp;nbsp;billion workers are exposed to excessive heat globally, resulting in more than 22.85&amp;nbsp;million occupational injuries each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This report represents a critical milestone in our collective response to the growing threat of extreme heat in the world of work,&amp;rdquo; said Joaquim Pintado Nunes, ILO&amp;rsquo;s Chief of Occupational Safety and Health and the Working Environment. &amp;ldquo;Aligned with the ILO&amp;rsquo;s mandate to promote safe and healthy working environments as a fundamental right, it offers robust, evidence-based guidance to help governments, employers and workers confront the escalating risks of climate change. Together with WHO and WMO, we call for urgent, coordinated action to safeguard the health, safety and dignity of the more than 2.4&amp;nbsp;billion workers exposed to excessive heat worldwide.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Call to action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guidance serves as a critical resource for policymakers, public health officials, and employers in mitigating the escalating impact of workplace heat stress. It aligns with key United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, calling for decisive actions that protect vulnerable workers, reduce poverty, and promote sustainable economic growth. Immediate implementation of policies and programmes that safeguard worker health and productivity in the face of climate change is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the context of accelerating climate crisis, this guidance serves as a vital tool to help countries respond decisively, protecting lives, livelihoods and economies from the growing threat of extreme heat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

  "content": "&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially designated Health Canada, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare/Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (MHLW/PMDA) of Japan, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the United Kingdom as WHO-Listed Authorities (WLAs), a status granted to national authorities that meet the highest international regulatory standards for medical products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these latest designations, WHO expands the growing list of WLAs, now involving 39 agencies across the world, supporting faster and broader access to quality-assured medical products, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Republic of Korea&amp;rsquo;s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) &amp;ndash; one of the first regulatory authorities to complete the WLA assessment for both medicines and vaccines in October 2023 &amp;ndash; has had its listing scope successfully expanded, now covering all regulatory functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This recognition reflects the deep commitment of these authorities to regulatory excellence,&amp;rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &amp;ldquo;Their designation as WHO-Listed Authorities is not only a testament to their robust regulatory systems but also a critical contribution to global public health. Strong and trusted regulators help ensure that people everywhere have access to safe, effective, and high-quality medical products.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 70% of countries worldwide still face significant challenges due to weak or inadequate regulatory systems for evaluating and authorizing medical products. The WLA framework promotes regulatory convergence, harmonization and international collaboration, allowing WHO Prequalification Programme and regulatory authorities, especially those in LMICs, to rely on the trusted work and decisions of designated agencies. This collaboration supports efficient use of limited resources, enabling better and faster access to quality-assured life-saving medical products to millions more people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The principle of reliance is central to WHO&amp;rsquo;s approach to regulatory systems strengthening and a cornerstone for effective, efficient and smart regulatory oversight of medical products,&amp;rdquo; said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems, Access and Data. &amp;ldquo;WHO-Listed Authorities are key enablers in promoting trust, transparency, and faster access to quality-assured medical products, especially in low- and middle-income countries.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world where health threats, including substandard and falsified medical products, know no borders, WLAs also serve as critical pillars of preparedness and equity, making life-saving products available more broadly, rapidly and efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The designations follow a rigorous performance evaluation process carried out by WHO using its globally recognized benchmarking and assessment tools. These evaluations were reviewed by the Technical Advisory Group on WLAs (TAG-WLA), which convened in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada, Japan and the UK&amp;rsquo;s regulatory authorities were previously recognized as Stringent Regulatory Authorities (SRAs). Their designation under the WLA framework marks an important step in moving beyond the old SRA system, while ensuring continuity and stability in global procurement processes of quality-assured medical products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2022 to replace the previous SRA model, the WLA initiative provides a transparent and evidence-based pathway for global recognition of regulatory authorities to facilitate regulatory convergence and reliance. It builds on decades of WHO leadership to help countries work together more closely on regulating medical products, speeding up access to safe, effective and quality-assured medical products for people around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

  "content": "&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has validated Kenya as having eliminated human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness as a public health problem, making it the tenth country to reach this important milestone. HAT is the second neglected tropical disease (NTD) to be eliminated in Kenya: the country was certified free of Guinea worm disease in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I congratulate the government and people of Kenya on this landmark achievement,&amp;rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &amp;ldquo;Kenya joins the growing ranks of countries freeing their populations of human African trypanosomiasis. This is another step towards making Africa free of neglected tropical diseases&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAT is a vector-borne disease caused by the blood parasite &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/em&gt;. It is transmitted to humans through the bites of tsetse flies that have acquired the parasites from infected humans or animals. Rural populations dependent on agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry or hunting are most at risk of exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the name indicates, HAT is transmitted only on the African continent. The disease exists in two forms, &lt;em&gt;gambiense&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rhodesiense&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;rhodesiense &lt;/em&gt;form (r-HAT), which is found in eastern and southern Africa, is the only one present in Kenya. It is caused by &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense&lt;/em&gt; and progresses rapidly, invading multiple organs including the brain. Without treatment, it is fatal within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kenya&amp;rsquo;s progress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This validation marks a major public health milestone for Kenya, as we celebrate the elimination of a deadly disease in our country. The achievement will not only protect our people but also pave the way for renewed economic growth and prosperity,&amp;rdquo; said Dr Aden Duale, Kenya&amp;rsquo;s Cabinet Secretary for Health. &amp;ldquo;This follows many years of dedication, hard work and collaboration&amp;rdquo;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first cases of HAT in Kenya were detected in the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Since then, Kenya has engaged in consistent control activities, without indigenous new cases reported for over 10 years. The last autochthonous case was detected in 2009, and the last two exported cases, infected in the Masai Mara National Reserve, were detected in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Kenya strengthened HAT surveillance in 12 health facilities in six historically endemic counties to act as sentinel sites. They were equipped with diagnostic tools and had their clinical personnel trained on diagnostic procedures, including the most sensitive and practical tests for r-HAT. The country also actively monitors the control and surveillance of tsetse flies and animal trypanosomiasis, both within and beyond the historical HAT endemic areas, supported by the national veterinary health authorities and the Kenya Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Council (KENTTEC). These activities and the related data provide supplementary backing to the claim of HAT elimination as a public health problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This key milestone reflects Kenya&amp;rsquo;s efforts and commitment over many years, as a collaboration between national and county governments, national research institutions, development partners and affected communities,&amp;rdquo; said Dr Patrick Amoth, EBS, Director General Health, Ministry of Health, Kenya. &amp;ldquo;The country remains fully committed to sustain the quality of care and surveillance in line with WHO&amp;rsquo;s recommendations&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supported by WHO and partners, including FIND, Kenya&amp;rsquo;s HAT elimination programme will now implement a post-validation surveillance plan to detect any potential resurgence or reintroduction of transmission. WHO continues to support ongoing monitoring in previously affected areas and maintains a stock of medicines to ensure rapid treatment of possible future cases, thanks to donations from Bayer AG and Sanofi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This success was made possible by the Ministry of Health&amp;rsquo;s leadership, the dedication of health workers in areas at risk and the support from key partners,&amp;rdquo; said Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, WHO Representative to Kenya. &amp;ldquo;WHO is proud to have contributed to this achievement and encourages all stakeholders to remain involved in post-validation monitoring&amp;rdquo;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Progress in global HAT elimination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 57 countries have eliminated at least one NTD. Of these, 10 (including Kenya) have successfully eliminated HAT as a public health problem.&amp;nbsp;The other countries that have reached this milestone are Benin, Chad, C&amp;ocirc;te d&amp;rsquo;Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Rwanda, Togo and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

  "content": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Breastfeeding is one of the most effective ways to ensure a baby&amp;rsquo;s health, development, and survival in the earliest stages of life. It acts as their first vaccine, providing protection against diseases including diarrhoea and pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investing in breastfeeding is an investment in the future, yet only 48 per cent of infants under six months are exclusively breastfed &amp;ndash; well below the World Health Assembly target of 60 per cent by 2030. This is due to the overlapping challenges for new mothers, health workers, and health systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of mothers around the world do not receive timely and skilled support in a healthcare setting when they need it most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a fifth of countries include infant and young child feeding training for the doctors and nurses who care for new mothers. This means the majority of the world&amp;rsquo;s mothers leave hospitals without proper guidance on how to breastfeed their babies and when to introduce complementary feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many countries, health systems are too often under-resourced, fragmented, or poorly equipped to deliver quality, consistent, evidence-based breastfeeding support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment in breastfeeding support remains critically low even though every dollar invested generates US$35 in economic returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we mark World Breastfeeding Week under the theme, &amp;ldquo;Prioritize breastfeeding: Create sustainable support systems&amp;rdquo;, WHO and UNICEF are calling on governments, health administrators, and partners to invest in high-quality breastfeeding support, by:&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ensuring adequate investment in equitable, quality maternal and newborn care, including breastfeeding support services;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;increasing national budget allocations for breastfeeding programmes;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;&quot;&gt;integrating breastfeeding counselling and support into routine maternal and child health services, including antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;&quot;&gt;ensuring all health service providers are equipped with the skills and knowledge required to support breastfeeding, including in emergency and humanitarian settings;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;&quot;&gt;strengthening community health systems to provide every new mother with ongoing, accessible breastfeeding support to for up to two years and beyond; and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;&quot;&gt;protecting breastfeeding by ensuring that the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes is applied in all health facilities and systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strengthening health systems to support breastfeeding is not just a health imperative, it is a moral and economic imperative.

  "description": "Tribute to Dr David Nabarro",
  "content": "&lt;p&gt;It is with great sadness that the World Health Organization mourns the passing of Dr David Nabarro on Friday 25 July at his home. He was 75. At WHO, David was at the forefront of multiple areas of work, including malaria control, humanitarian crisis response and outbreaks. Most recently, David served as a WHO Special Envoy on COVID-19. To all who knew him, David was a widely respected, impactful and loved champion of health, equity and disadvantaged people worldwide, who supported many in their career development with his vision, skill, compassion and patience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was &amp;ldquo;Deeply shocked and saddened by the passing of our dear friend, colleague and WHO Envoy David Nabarro. David was a great champion of global health and health equity, and a wise, generous mentor to countless individuals. His work touched and impacted so many lives across the world. On behalf of WHO, I&amp;rsquo;m extending our heartfelt condolences to David&amp;rsquo;s family, friends and colleagues. Rest in peace, my dear friend. We will dearly miss your expertise, wisdom and kindness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David wore many hats, reflecting his expertise, energy and readiness to help across a wide range of sectors, including health, nutrition and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1999-2005, David held senior leadership positions at WHO, starting as the Executive Director responsible for the Roll Back Malaria Project and the Office of the Director-General, before being appointed the Director-General&amp;rsquo;s Special Representative for Health Action in Crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, he joined the United Nations, serving as UN System Senior Coordinator for Avian and Pandemic Influenza (2005-2014), the UN Secretary-General&amp;rsquo;s Special Representative for Food Security and Nutrition (2008-2014), Coordinator of the Movement for Scaling Up Nutrition (2011-2014, as Assistant Secretary-General), the UN SG&amp;rsquo;s Special Envoy for the West Africa Ebola Outbreak Response (2014-2015), and Special Adviser for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Climate Change (2016 - 2017, as Under-Secretary-General).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the WHO Director-General appointed David as chair of the expert group on the reform of WHO&amp;rsquo;s work on outbreaks and emergencies in 2015.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2018, he received the World Food Prize for leadership on nutrition.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David was Co-Director (from mid-2019-2025) and Chair of Global Health at the Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College, London. He also founded and was Strategic Director of the Swiss-based 4SD Foundation (Skills Systems and Synergies for Sustainable Development) with Florence Lasbennes in 2018, training and mentoring leaders for sustainable development.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2018 and 2025, David curated the Food Systems Dialogues as a contribution to the transformation of food systems. He also contributed to preparations for the UN&amp;rsquo;s September 2019 Climate Action Summit and co-facilitated the coalition that advanced the Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) workstream (co-led by China and New Zealand). David co-chaired the forum on Climate Change and Health that completed its work at the World Innovation Summit for Health in November 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, David was appointed Special Envoy of WHO Director General on COVID-19, a position that he held until his passing on 25 July 2025. Under his strategic leadership, 4SD led the Summit Dialogues that contributed to the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit from which a network of National Convenors of Food Systems transformation has emerged and continues to be active today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Ukraine war began, David joined the UN Secretary-General's Food, Energy and Finance crisis response group, co-leading the Food Workstream. King Charles III&amp;nbsp;knighted David in 2023 for his&amp;nbsp;contributions to global health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://4sdfoundation.org/news/a-difficult-announcement/&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; titled &amp;ldquo;A Difficult Announcement,&amp;rdquo; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://4sdfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;4SD Foundation&lt;/a&gt; said David passed at his home on Friday 25 July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;David&amp;rsquo;s generosity and unwavering commitment to improve the lives of others will be sorely missed. He leaves behind his beloved wife, Flo, his children, Tom, Ollie, Polly, Josie, Lucas and seven grandchildren.

  "title": "Prognostic Utility of Prothrombin Time-International Normalized Ratio, Interleukin-6, and High-Density Lipoprotein Levels in Patients With Severe Sepsis",
  "description": "BackgroundA foremost cause of mortality in intensive care units is sepsis, especially in resource-limited nations such as India, where delays in patient presentations and limited diagnostic facilities pose common challenges. While conventional severity scores such as Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) are helpful, the multiple assessments required and labor-intensive calculations create an impractical situation for some clinicians. Thus, an urgent need arises for reliable biomarkers that could be measured at admission for faster and better prognosis. In this context, this study aims to evaluate the combined prognostic potential of three biomarkers, each reflecting a key facet in sepsis pathophysiology: coagulation (prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR)), inflammation (interleukin-6 (IL-6)), and immunometabolism (high-density lipoprotein (HDL)).MethodologyThis prospective, observational study was conducted from July 2023 to March 2025 among 152 adult patients with severe sepsis admitted to Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital in Ajmer, India. Admission levels of PT-INR, IL-6, and HDL cholesterol were measured. Sepsis was diagnosed based on the Sepsis-3 criteria (SOFA score increase of ≥2 points). The prognostic utility of the biomarkers was assessed by correlating their admission levels with clinical severity scores (SOFA and APACHE II) and in-hospital mortality. Statistical analysis included non-parametric tests, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and binary logistic regression.ResultsOf the 152 patients enrolled, the in-hospital mortality rate was 38.8%. Non-survivors had significantly higher admission levels of IL-6 (104.87 ± 28.45 pg/mL) and PT-INR (1.97 ± 0.50) and significantly lower levels of HDL (34.89 ± 8.85 mg/dL) compared to survivors. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that IL-6 was an exceptionally strong predictor of mortality, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.995, and 100% sensitivity and specificity at a cutoff of 75 pg/mL. PT-INR showed a moderate predictive ability (AUC = 0.606), while HDL was a weaker predictor (AUC = 0.405). A combined logistic regression model incorporating all three biomarkers showed superior prognostic accuracy with an AUC of 0.94.ConclusionsThe combined use of admission-day biomarkers reflecting inflammation (IL-6), coagulation (PT-INR), and immunometabolism (HDL) provides a powerful and synergistic tool for early risk stratification in severe sepsis. While each marker offers unique prognostic insights, the multi-marker approach demonstrated superior predictive accuracy compared to individual markers alone. Specifically, IL-6 emerged as a remarkably potent and accurate predictor of mortality in this high-acuity patient cohort. This multi-marker strategy is particularly valuable for improving early prognostication and guiding treatment decisions in resource-limited settings.",

  "description": "ABSTRACTBackground\nZiziphus vulgaris L. and Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze are medicinal plants widely used in various ethnomedical systems, particularly in Iranian Traditional Medicine, for the treatment of various diseases.ObjectivesWhile their biological activities are well‐documented, their effectiveness against Varroa destructor, a significant ectoparasite of Apis mellifera (honeybees), remains unknown. As V. destructor poses a serious threat to honeybee populations globally, it is crucial for researchers to explore novel control methods.MethodsIn this study, we evaluated the anti‐Varroa activity of Z. vulgaris and C. sinensis at different concentrations (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 µL/L air) and exposure times (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 h).ResultsThe results showed that mite mortality increased in parallel with the increase in extract concentration and exposure time. Importantly, the plant extracts did not cause significant mortality in A. mellifera compared to the control group.ConclusionsIn conclusion, our findings suggest that these plant extracts could be effective agents for managing V. destructor.",

  "title": "General and special education teachers’ readiness for artificial intelligence in classrooms: A structural equation modeling study of knowledge, attitudes, and practices in select UAE public and private schools",
  "description": "As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes global education systems, understanding educators’ readiness to integrate AI into classroom practices is essential. This study examines the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of general and special education teachers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) regarding AI in education. Drawing on the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) and Universal Design for Learning (UDL), we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess the relationships among KAP domains, including the moderating effects of demographic factors such as teaching experience, academic role, and prior exposure to AI tools. Data were collected from 161 educators in selected public and private schools across four UAE emirates, with the majority representing private and urban school settings. The findings revealed that teachers’ attitudes significantly predicted AI-related classroom practices, whereas knowledge had a weaker, but positive association. Mediation analysis further showed that knowledge had a significant indirect effect on practice through attitudes, confirming the hypothesized KAP pathway. Moderation analyses highlighted the variability in AI engagement based on gender and academic position, suggesting differentiated readiness across the subgroups. This study contributes to global conversations on teacher preparedness by offering a model for assessing institutional and pedagogical readiness for AI integration in urban school contexts. Implications for professional development, inclusive curriculum design, and educational technology policy are discussed, with relevance to digitally transforming educational systems in comparable settings.",

  "title": "Comprehensive analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment in gastric cancer and peritoneal metastasis based on single-cell RNA sequencing analysis",
  "description": "The development and metastasis of gastric cancer are complex processes involving the TME (Tumor microenvironment) and the interactions between various cell types. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms and biological processes underlying gastric cancer and its metastasis using single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) with the aim of identifying new targets and approaches for clinical treatment. R version 4.4.1 and the SeuratV5 package were used to process 20 scRNA-seq samples sourced from the GEO database. Highly variable genes were selected for GO (Gene Ontology), KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and GSAV (Gene set variation analysis) enrichment analyses. CytoTRACE, CellChat, and Monocle3 analyses were conducted to investigate cell communication and pseudotemporal dynamics in the PM (Peritoneal Metastasis) and GC (Gastric Cancer) groups. Additionally, the prognostic significance of key genes was assessed by integrating data from the TCGA clinical database. A total of 2,626,594 peritoneal metastasis cells and 17,894 gastric cancer cells were identified, revealing 13 distinct cell clusters. Gene enrichment analyses identified high expression in several pathways (P53, Wnt and JAK-STAT3) in TAMs and mast cells. Cell communication was more robust in the GC group than the PM group, with TAMs (Tumor-associated Macrophages) and mast cells showing elevated expression of the CCL5-CCR1 ligand-receptor signaling axis in both groups. Pseudotemporal analysis demonstrated the differentiation potential of TAMs into mast cells, with APOC1, C1QB, FCN1, FTL, S100A9, CD1C, CD1E and FCER1A identified as the top eight genes driving this process. High expression levels of these genes, along with CCL5 and CCR1, were associated with poor long-term survival in cancer patients. scRNA-seq identified the intricate tumor immune microenvironment, highlighting the pivotal roles of TAMs and mast cells in gastric cancer peritoneal metastasis. The CCL5-CCR1 pathway emerged as a potential immune checkpoint, offering novel insights for future immunotherapeutic and targeted therapeutic strategies in the treatment of gastric cancer peritoneal metastasis.",

  "title": "Unveiling the Phytochemical Profile and Anti‐Cancer Potential of \nLantana camara\n Leaf and Root Extracts Against MCF‐7, HepG2, and A549 Cancer Cell Lines",
  "description": "ABSTRACTCancer is a life‐threatening disease; liver cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer account for high prevalence worldwide. The \nLantana camara\n (LC) plant is known for its cytotoxicity in treating certain diseases. However, the effect of leaf and root extract of LC on induction of apoptosis and lowering the proliferation of cancerous cells was estimated in the current study. Leaf and root extracts of LC were prepared using the rotary method, in which mineral analysis was done quantitatively through the spectrophotometry technique. In contrast, phytochemical composition was assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Fifteen bioactive compounds were detected from the LC root extract. The major compounds found were lupeol (52.94%), Lup‐20(29)‐en‐3‐one (8.231%), 9‐octadecynoic acid (21%), N‐hexadecenoic acid (16%), Phytol (5.842%), Hexadecenoic acid (5.301%), Caryophyllene oxide (4.772%) and 2,3‐Dihydro‐2,5‐dihydroxy‐6‐methyl‐4H‐pyran‐4‐one (3.018%). Cytotoxicity was estimated through the MTT assay by using two different sourced cell lines as control (HUVECs and Vero). VEGF was done to confirm the proliferation of treated cells; apoptosis was examined by Annexin‐V and Hoechst 33342 staining; cell viability was checked through the trypan blue and crystal violet staining method. Phytochemical analysis and antioxidant activities showed better results in the LCroot extract than the LCleaf extract. Similarly, DPPH measured for antioxidant analysis also confirmed the better results in LCroot (178.921 ± 0.12) (p < 0.01). In cell culture experiments, LCroot extract showed high cytotoxicity and morphological changes in MCF‐7, HepG2, and A549 cancerous cell lines, but a reduced cytotoxic effect was observed in non‐cancerous cell lines (HUVECs and Vero). ELISA for apoptosis and angiogenesis confirmed the significantly increased apoptosis (p < 0.0001) (Annexin‐V) and reduced angiogenesis/proliferation (VEGF). Further, the Hoechst 33342 staining method also confirmed the increased apoptosis in treated cancerous cells with 50 μg/mL LCroot extract as compared to untreated groups and normal HUVECs.",

  "title": "Early life injury alters spinal astrocyte development",
  "description": "Neonatal injury alters synaptic transmission in the spinal superficial dorsal horn (SDH), resulting in aberrant amplification of ascending nociceptive transmission. Astrocytes orchestrate synapse development and function across the CNS and play a critical role in the emergence and maintenance of persistent pain. However, little is currently known about the postnatal development of spinal astrocytes, nor about how the maturation of SDH astrocytes is impacted by early life injury. Here, we used a hindpaw incision model of postsurgical pain in postnatal day (P)3 mice of both sexes to elucidate the effects of neonatal injury on the maturation of SDH astrocytes. Three-dimensional morphological analysis of individual astrocytes revealed that incision elicits age-dependent changes to astrocyte structure. At P4, spinal astrocytes in incised mice show increased size and complexity compared to naïve controls. This is reversed at P10 and P24, as astrocytes from incised mice are smaller and less ramified compared to their naïve counterparts. Transcriptomic analysis of spinal astrocytes revealed acute changes to gene expression after neonatal injury, as 76 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at P4 (such as Thbs1, Efemp1, Acta1, Acta2, Tpm2 and Fgf14), which included genes related to cell motility and cytoskeletal organization, but very few DEGs were detected at P10 and P24. Lastly, we identified that microglial engulfment of astrocyte material occurs in the developing dorsal horn, and that this process is altered by neonatal incision in a sex-dependent manner. These data illustrate, for the first time, that neonatal injury alters the postnatal development of spinal astrocytes.",

  "title": "Adult mortality and nutrition in rural Senegal: evidence of an epidemiologic transition",
  "description": "ABSTRACTBackgroundGlobal mortality transitions are driven by the epidemiologic transition, resulting in a rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are partly shaped by the nutrition transition and associated chronic conditions. In low- and middle-income countries, these shifts are often viewed as primarily urban phenomena. Rural populations may therefore be overlooked in efforts to prevent and manage NCDs, despite facing critical public health challenges.ObjectiveThis study examines changing patterns of adult mortality and causes of death in rural Senegal to illustrate ongoing mortality, epidemiologic, and nutrition transitions.MethodsUsing data from three rural sites in the Senegalese Health and Demographic Surveillance System, we analysed adult mortality from 1985 to 2020. We calculated all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates among individuals aged 15 to 70 years, based on causes of death determined through verbal autopsy.ResultsMortality declined across all age groups. Deaths from communicable diseases, maternal conditions, and undernutrition decreased substantially. NCDs have surpassed communicable diseases as the leading cause of death. Causes of death associated with undernutrition have declined, while diet-related NCDs have increased.ConclusionsAdult mortality is declining in the three rural Senegalese sites studied, due to a decline in epidemics. However, NCDs now pose a major rural health threat, consistent with epidemiologic transition theory. The reversal between mortality patterns associated with undernutrition and diet-related NCDs may signal an ongoing nutrition transition. Strong health systems are crucial for both preventing and treating NCDs, and robust health information systems are needed to support deeper analysis of this issue.",

  "title": "Survival analysis of under-five mortality and associated risk factors using survival analysis approaches",
  "description": "The risk of under-five mortality is a vital measure of healthcare system performance and directly reflects progress toward Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.2, which targets the elimination of preventable deaths among newborns and children under-five, aiming to reduce mortality rates to at least 25 per 1,000 live births by 2030. While Ghana has made notable progress in lowering child mortality in recent decades, the current rates remain above this benchmark. Identifying the predictors of under-five mortality is therefore critical for shaping evidence-based policies and targeted interventions that can accelerate progress toward SDG 3 and improve child health outcomes. To explore these predictors, we employed advanced survival modeling techniques. The conventional Cox-proportional hazards (Cox-PH) model assumes constant covariate effects over time, but violations of this assumption can lead to biased results. To address this, we used the extended Cox-PH model, which accommodates time-varying effects. Data were drawn from the 2022 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS), based on a stratified two-stage cluster sampling design. Since under-five deaths are relatively rare (<10%), traditional models may yield unstable hazard ratios. We therefore applied Bayesian survival analysis to obtain more stable estimates and incorporated multilevel survival modeling to account for unobserved heterogeneity within the DHS sampling structure. Results showed that male children (HR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.11–1.30) and twins (HR = 2.90, 95% CI: 2.51–3.34) faced higher mortality risk. Caesarean delivery (HR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.08–2.37) and larger birth size also increased hazards. In contrast, term birth (HR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.14–0.19), maternal education, and higher household wealth were protective. Children requiring special attention after delivery had improved survival (HR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38–0.89). Strengthening maternal and newborn care, coupled with addressing socioeconomic inequalities, is essential to reducing child mortality and achieving Ghana’s SDG 3.2 targets.",

  "title": "Ferroptosis in Haematological Malignancies: From Regulatory Networks to Novel Therapeutic Opportunities",
  "description": "ABSTRACTHaematological malignancies encompass a wide spectrum of blood cell disorders with diverse prognoses. Despite recent advances in therapy, many of these disorders remain incurable or exhibit relapse and drug resistance. Ferroptosis, an iron‐dependent form of cell death caused by lipid peroxidation, holds promise as a strategy to overcome the resistance seen with conventional therapies. This review aims to succinctly outline current research concerning the regulatory function of ferroptosis‐related genes (FRGs) and various types of non‐coding RNAs (ncRNAs), as well as various types of ferroptosis inducers (FINs), encompassing small molecule compounds, natural derivatives, synthetic agents and nanoparticles. The exploration delves into the mechanisms by which FINs operate, including inhibiting the system Xc−, deactivating the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), disrupting glutathione (GSH) production and interfering with iron or lipid metabolism. The investigation emphasises the functioning of these agents and the underlying molecular processes driving the initiation of ferroptosis. A comprehensive assessment reveals the potential utility of FINs as innovative treatments for haematological neoplasms, offering insights into a novel therapeutic approach.",

  "title": "Roles of tick-cofeeding hedgehogs in the natural transmission of spotted fever group Rickettsia",
  "description": "Tick-borne spotted fever group Rickettsia (SFGR) poses a significant threat to public health worldwide. The cofeeding behavior of ticks attaching host animals, such as hedgehogs, has been identified as a potential mechanism for transmitting SFGR between infected and uninfected ticks, potentially increasing the prevalence of SFGR. However, the overall positive rate of SFGR in free-living ticks remains relatively low, suggesting that the role of tick-cofeeding in amplifying SFGR prevalence may not be as substantial as previously believed. To explore the impact of tick-cofeeding hedgehogs on the natural transmission of SFGR, to clarify the underlying hypotheses, and to provide robust data to support targeted prevention and control strategies for spotted fever, this study developed a transmission model using tick-cofeeding hedgehogs that simulates the natural transmission process. Both Rickettsia-infected and uninfected tick populations were established and used for cofeeding on mice or hedgehogs. Among formerly uninfected nymphs that cofed on mice, 75.61% acquired Rickettsia after engorgement, but this infection rate dropped sharply to 9.68% after molting. In contrast, formerly uninfected adults that cofed on hedgehogs showed a 100% infection rate after engorgement. However, the infection rates declined significantly in their offspring, with only 11.12% of normal-hatching eggs and 3.12% of larvae testing positive. Additionally, we observed mortality in infected engorged adults and their eggs. Our results demonstrate that while tick-cofeeding on hedgehogs can lead to a high positive rate of Rickettsia in ticks, the infections acquired through cofeeding fail to sustain this high positivity rate due to several mechanisms. Firstly, rickettsiae obtained through cofeeding or blood meals do not consistently establish infections in all recipient ticks, resulting in a significant decline in positive rates as ticks progress to subsequent developmental stages. Secondly, adult ticks infected via cofeeding tend to reduce the infection rate in their offspring through various mechanisms, including tick mortality caused by rickettsiae, egg hatching failure, and a low transovarial transmission rate. Additionally, in natural settings, infections from other pathogens may similarly contribute to tick mortality and reduced egg hatching. This study elucidates why rickettsiae maintain a low prevalence in nature and evaluates the actual effects of tick-cofeeding on pathogen distribution among ticks. While tick-cofeeding on host animals have been considered important amplifiers of SFGR prevalence, our findings indicate that their impact is not as significant as previously assumed.",

  "description": "BackgroundChronic wounds present a major health challenge, and traditional remedies are frequently employed in developing nations for wound treatment. This study sought to assess the safety and effectiveness of various solvent extracts from Cordia africana using excision and incision wound models in mice.MethodsThe dried, coarsely ground 500 g of plant leaves were separately macerated three times with 80% methanol, absolute methanol, chloroform, and aqueous water. Acute dermal toxicity was assessed by applying 2000 mg/kg of the 10% w/w of the solvent extracts. In both wound models, animals were randomly divided into four groups of five mice each. Group I received a simple ointment and served as the negative control. Group IV was treated with nitrofurazone (0.2%) ointment as the positive control. Groups II and III were treated with 5% w/w and 10% w/w ointments of the solvent extracts, respectively.ResultsThe acute dermal toxicity studies demonstrated that the plant leaf extracts are safe, as there were no signs of toxicity observed. In the excision wound model, the application of 5% and 10% ointments of the 80% methanol extract resulted in significant (p < 0.05) wound contraction compared to the negative control group, starting from day 13 and day 5, respectively. Similarly, 10% ointments of both absolute methanol and chloroform extracts significantly (p < 0.05) reduced wound size starting from day 7. Furthermore, the time required for complete epithelization was significantly shorter (p < 0.05) for the 80% methanol, chloroform, and absolute methanol extracts compared to the negative control. The chloroform fraction and 10% ointment of the 80% methanol extracts also significantly increased hydroxylproline content. The 5% and 10% chloroform extract ointments (66.02% and 72.20%, respectively) and the 10% ointment with an 80% methanol extract (55.49%) significantly improved the tensile strength of the mice skin (p < 0.05) compared to the group treated with a simple ointment (1.6%).ConclusionThe study revealed that Cordia africana leaf extracts possess significant wound-healing properties, supporting its traditional medicinal use. It was found that using less polar solvents is more effective in extracting components with enhanced wound-healing effects.",

  "title": "Trends and inequalities in full immunization coverage among two-year-olds in Sierra Leone, 2008–2019",
  "description": "BackgroundImmunization is a cornerstone of public health, preventing numerous vaccine-preventable diseases. However, disparities in immunization coverage persist globally, particularly in low-income countries like Sierra Leone. This study aims to examine the trends and socioeconomic and geographic inequalities in full immunization coverage among two-year-olds in Sierra Leone between 2008 and 2019.MethodsThis study utilised data from the Sierra Leone Demographic Health Surveys conducted in 2008, 2013, and 2019. The Health Equity Assessment Toolkit software developed by the World Health Organisation was used to calculate various inequality measures, including Difference, Ratio, Population-Attributable Risk, and Population-Attributable Fraction. An assessment of inequality was conducted across six stratifiers: maternal age, maternal economic status, maternal education level, place of residence, child sex, and sub-national province.ResultsBetween 2008 and 2013, the coverage of full immunization coverage among two-year-olds in Sierra Leone increased from 41.1% in 2008 to 73.1% in 2013; however, the coverage decreased to 50.4% in 2019. The inequality associated with maternal age, sex of the child, and sub-national level increased between 2008 and 2019. However, the results were not statistically significant for maternal age and sex of the child. Similarly, inequalities existed with economic status, education, and place of residence steadily decreased over the same period, but the results were also not statistically significant.ConclusionThe study’s findings highlight the need for sustained efforts to improve immunization coverage in Sierra Leone. While there was progress between 2008 and 2013, the subsequent decline emphasizes the importance of maintaining vital immunization programs. Addressing the significant regional disparities, particularly the gap between the southern and northern regions, is recommended. This requires targeted interventions to improve access to immunization services, strengthen health systems, and address the northern region’s underlying social and economic factors. Additionally, ongoing monitoring and evaluation are essential to identify and address emerging challenges and ensure equitable access to immunization for all children in Sierra Leone.",

  "title": "Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation: Conservation across the Drosophila genus",
  "description": "The inherent differences between sex chromosomes in males and females create conflicts in gene expression, driving the evolution of regulatory mechanisms such as Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation (MSCI), a process that transcriptionally silences the sex chromosomes during male meiosis. In this study, we explore the evolutionary dynamics of MSCI within the Drosophila genus by analyzing transcriptomes across different stages of spermatogenesis in D. melanogaster and its progressively more distant relatives, D. simulans, D. willistoni, and D. mojavensis. Stage-enriched bulk RNA sequencing, showing a strong correlation in spermatogenic gene expression patterns among these species, revealed that MSCI dates back to the early evolution of the Drosophila genus, impacting the regulation of both coding and long non-coding RNAs. Notably, for newly evolved genes, X-linked genes show higher expression levels than autosomal genes during mitosis and meiosis, indicating that MSCI predominantly regulates older genes. In contrast, newly evolved autosomal genes exhibit a gradual increase in expression throughout spermatogenesis, reaching their peak in the post-meiotic phase. During this phase, the expression of X-linked new genes decreases, eventually aligning with that of autosomal genes. This expression pattern suggests that haploid selection plays a crucial role in the regulation of new genes, with monoallelic expression of the X chromosome providing an advantage across all stages of germline development, while autosomal gene expression gains a selective edge primarily in the post-meiotic phase. Together, these findings provide new insights into the evolution of sex chromosomes and highlight the critical role of MSCI in shaping gene expression profiles in Drosophila.",

  "title": "Viral driving force on virulence differentiation of a rice phytopathogenic fungus and the implication for biocontrol",
  "description": "ABSTRACTViruses are the most abundant biological entities in natural environments. Mycoviruses or fungal viruses are viruses that infect fungi and are being increasingly recognized. However, their ecological function in regulating microbial communities is not well understood. Here, we analyzed the differentiation of the biological characteristics of 32 Rhizoctonia solani strains isolated from rice and confirmed that there was obvious differentiation, especially in virulence. Screening of dsRNA and sequence determination showed that all 32 strains carried viruses displaying a high virus-carrying rate, which was composed of a diverse variety of mycoviruses showing genetic relationships with 15 different families and unclassified virus. In addition, we conducted experiments on multiple horizontal viral infections via hyphal anastomosis between different strains, a simulated ecological environment in a culture dish, and evaluated the dsRNA profiles and virulence of the derivative strains. The results revealed that R. solani strains might suffer multiple infections of mycoviruses via mycelial contact between a multitude of strains and lead to virulence differentiation, thus confirming that mycoviruses are an important driving force of virulence differentiation in this fungus. Moreover, a hypovirulent strain, DWZ-6, was obtained via multiple horizontal viral transfers. Overall, this study provides insights into the ecological implications of mycovirus infection in the virulence differentiation of plant pathogenic fungi and the means of obtaining hypovirulent strains with biological control potential, all of which might serve as a basis for monitoring epidemics of fungal plant disease and developing an environmentally friendly biological control approach.",

  "title": "Horizon Scanning Methods for Health Care Technology Innovation Identification: Rapid Scoping Review of Patent Research Studies",
  "description": "AbstractBackgroundPatents are an early sign of innovation, yet their role in horizon scanning for health care remains unclear.ObjectiveThis study investigates the role of, and methods for, patent analysis in advancing health care technology innovation in a sector that is characterized by diverse health care technologies and significant research investment. Patents are critical early indicators of innovation, supporting horizon scanning and weak signal detection. The study aimed to identify intellectual property sources, evaluate methods for patent retrieval and analysis, and outline objectives for using patent data to anticipate trends and inform health care strategies.MethodsA rapid scoping review was conducted following Cochrane Rapid Review Methods recommendations and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, with a preregistered protocol on the Open Science Framework. Searches in Embase, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science targeted records published 2020 onward to capture the most recent sources, methods, and tools. Three independent reviewers screened studies using Rayyan (Qatar Computing Research Institute). We included any study type published since 2020 that provided patent sources data, methods, and tools applied to the study of health care technologies. Our data extraction included bibliographic details, study characteristics, and methodological information. Risk of bias assessments were not undertaken. Narrative and tabular methods, supplemented by visual charts, were used to synthesize findings.ResultsOur searches identified 1741 studies, of which 124 were included after title, abstract, and full-text screening, with 54% being original research, 43.5% reviews, and the remainder being conference abstracts (2.5%). Most studies (68%) relied solely on patent databases, while others searched the gray and published literature. Research objectives of the included studies were grouped into 10 themes, with trend analysis (50%) and the provision of recommendations for future research, policy, and strategy development (20%) being the most common. Our review identified up to 47 patent databases, with 27% of studies using multiple sources. Whenever time limits were reported, the mean time horizon for patent searches was 24.6 years, ranging from 1900 to 2019. Automated approaches, used in 33% (n=43) of studies, frequently used tools such as Gephi (Gephi Consortium) for network visualization. Disease mapping based on National Institute for Health and Care Excellence classification indicated that cancer (19%) and respiratory conditions (16%), particularly COVID-19, were key areas.ConclusionsPatent data are valuable for identifying technological trends and informing policy and research strategies. While patents provide crucial insights into emerging technologies, inconsistent deduplication practices across studies pose the risk of data inflation, accentuating the need for transparency and rigor. Finally, this review emphasized the importance of data transformation and visualization in detecting emerging trends, with Python and R being the most commonly used programming languages for developing custom tools.",

  "description": "Trichomes are crucial for plant defense and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. In Artemisia argyi, T-shaped non-glandular trichomes (TSTs) are a defining morphological feature and the primary structural component of moxa floss. We observed pronounced TST accumulation on the lower leaf surfaces. To elucidate the genetic regulation of TST development, we performed comparative transcriptomics of TSTs and non-TST tissues. This identified several MIXTA-like transcription factors (named AarMIXTAs) as key regulators of TST differentiation. Phylogenetic analyses revealed gene expansion and functional divergence between the AarMIXTAs and their homologs in Artemisia annua. Heterologous overexpression of AarMIXTA1.2 in Arabidopsis significantly increased TST density, demonstrating its positive regulatory role via transcriptional activation of downstream targets. These findings elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying TST morphogenesis and provide a genetic framework for enhancing moxa floss yield in A. argyi cultivars.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s44307-025-00077-5.",

Sponge-derived natural products are often endowed with favorable pharmaceutical bioactivities, and paired with their structural complexity, have long served as title compounds for chemical syntheses. Sponges are holobionts, in that the sponge host is associated with symbiotic and commensal microbiome. Natural products isolated from sponges can be produced by the sponge host, or the associated microbiome. Recent genomic studies have shed light on the sponge eukaryotic host as the true producer of several classes of sponge-derived peptidic natural products.

  "title": "Trends in maternal mortality and stillbirths by county in health facility data, Kenya, 2011-2022",
  "description": "BackgroundReports on maternal deaths and stillbirths in health facilities are a critical but underutilized source of information to monitor the quality of care. In addition, with increasing coverage of deliveries by health facilities, such data can improve population estimates of maternal mortality and stillbirth rates. Data quality concerns, however, have often deterred use of facility data. This study aims to assess subnational trends in institutional mortality and examine its utility for improving population-based estimates of mortality.MethodsData from the routine monthly reporting system of the Ministry of Health in Kenya were used to assess levels and trends in maternal mortality and stillbirth rates in 47 counties from 2011 to 2022. Data quality was assessed using multiple methods, including consistency of annual reporting of live births, stillbirths and maternal deaths by counties, plausibility of the ratio of reported stillbirths to maternal death, the county institutional mortality in comparison to delivery coverage, socioeconomic development and health system characteristics. The consistency between institutional and population estimates of mortality was assessed using different scenarios.ResultsInstitutional live birth coverage increased from 64.0% in 2014 to 87.8% in 2022, ranging from 49 to 99% in counties. Kenya and 39 of its 47 counties experienced a decline in institutional maternal mortality ratio and stillbirth rate during the study period 2011–2022. The national institutional maternal mortality decline stagnated from 2018 and was 99 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022. Consistency of reported data by county was good over time but several indicators suggest that maternal death reporting was incomplete and more so in less-developed counties. Estimates of the population maternal mortality ratio, derived from the facility data, were much lower than global estimates or census results, while the stillbirth rates were consistent.ConclusionThe health facility data on maternal death and stillbirths are an important data source for monitoring national and subnational institutional maternal mortality and stillbirth rates and can also inform population estimates. Systematic sustained assessment of reporting completeness will be critical to achieve the full potential of facility data-derived mortality monitoring.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12884-025-07726-6.",

  "title": "Probing three-dimensional cyclooctatetraene for nucleobase modification in aptamer selection",
  "description": "Decoration of aptamers with chemical modifications at the level of nucleobases grants access to alternative binding modes, which often result in improved binding properties. Most functional groups involved in such endeavours mimic the side chains of amino acids or are based on sp2-dominated moieties. While this approach has met undeniable success, trends in modern drug discovery seem to favor sp3-rich compounds over aromatic derivatives. Here, we report the use of a nucleotide modified with the three-dimensional, highly flexible cyclooctatetraene carboxylate (COTc). This nucleotide was engaged in an SELEX experiment against the biomarker PvLDH. Tightly binding aptamers were identified, which displayed dissociation constants in the low nM range, representing a significant improvement compared to previously identified cubamers. These modified aptamers clearly underscore the usefulness of COTc as a bioisostere replacement of aromatic moieties not only in small compounds but also in functional nucleic acids.",

  "title": "Metabolism-driven posttranslational modifications and immune regulation: Emerging targets for immunotherapy",
  "description": "The interplay between cellular metabolism and immune regulation is central to immune function and disease progression, revealing notable therapeutic opportunities. Upon activation, immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet heightened demands for energy and biosynthesis, reshaping regulatory networks across epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic layers. Metabolite-derived posttranslational modifications (PTMs) serve as pivotal mechanisms integrating metabolic intermediates with immune signaling pathways. Beyond classical acetylation, diverse nonacetyl PTMs—including lactylation, succinylation, malonylation, palmitoylation, and myristoylation—modify histone and nonhistone proteins, regulating gene expression, protein stability, subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, and protein-protein interactions. Advances in mass spectrometry and bioinformatics now enable precise characterization of these PTMs, uncovering their broad roles in immune regulation. This review summarizes current progress in immunometabolism and explores future directions such as mechanistic studies, combination strategies, and clinical applications. Metabolite-driven PTMs critically connect metabolism to immune regulation, suggesting promising therapeutic approaches for cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory diseases.",

  "title": "Phytochemical profiling and bioactivity validation of Moringa oleifera leaves: Antimicrobial, antidiarrheal, analgesic, and in silico insights",
  "description": "The increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance and the need for new medicines have renewed interest in medicinal plants like Moringa oleifera Lam., a fast-growing tree from the Moringaceae family that can survive in dry conditions. It is easily recognized by its compound leaves and long seed pods. Traditionally, it has been widely used in Ayurvedic medicine and as a nutrient-rich food source, with its leaves, pods, and seeds employed for treating malnutrition, inflammation, and over 300 ailments across South Asia and Africa. A methanolic leaf extract was prepared and analyzed via GC-MS/MS for phytoconstituents. Antimicrobial activity was tested against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi using disc diffusion (100 µg/disc), compared to standard antibiotics (30 µg/disc). Antidiarrheal (castor oil-induced model) and analgesic (acetic acid-induced writhing) effects were assessed at 200 and 400 mg/kg doses, with Loperamide and Diclofenac as standards, respectively. Molecular docking analyzed interactions of key compounds with therapeutic targets (URO, EGFR, DHFR, etc.). GC-MS/MS revealed 79 bioactive compounds including 4,5-dimethoxy-2-biphenylcarboxylic acid (14.32%), gamma-sitosterol (3.83%) and stigmasterol (0.81%). The extract showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, with strongest inhibition against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19 mm) and Salmonella typhi (19 mm), though 30–50% less potent than standard antibiotics. In antidiarrheal testing, 400 mg/kg dose reduced diarrheal episodes by 58.06% compared to control, while in analgesic assay it decreased writhing by 59.18%. Molecular docking demonstrated superior binding of compounds 57, 65 and 61 to molecular targets, with compound 57 showing strongest affinity to URO (−6.7 kcal/mol) and compound 65 to EGFR (−9.6 kcal/mol). ADME/T analysis revealed compounds C57, C59 and C61 possessed optimal drug-likeness (log P 1.33–3.02), high GI absorption, and no predicted toxicity – contrasting with poorly absorbed compounds (C13, C28; TPSA>150). Moringa oleifera methanolic leaves extract demonstrated broad-spectrum bioactivity, validating its traditional uses. While less potent than synthetic drugs, its multi-target mechanisms and bioactive diversity highlight its potential as an adjunct therapy. Further studies should isolate active compounds and optimize formulations for clinical applications.",

  "title": "Design optimization of high-sensitivity PCF-SPR biosensor using machine learning and explainable AI",
  "description": "Photonic crystal fiber based surface plasmon resonance (PCF-SPR) biosensors are sophisticated optical sensing platforms that enable precise detection of minute refractive index (RI) variations for various applications. This study introduces a highly sensitive, low-loss, and simply designed PCF-SPR biosensor for label-free analyte detection, operating across a broad RI range of 1.31 to 1.42. In addition to conventional methods, machine learning (ML) regression techniques were integrated to predict key optical properties, while explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), were used to analyze model outputs and identify the most influential design parameters. This hybrid approach significantly accelerates sensor optimization, reduces computational costs, and improves design efficiency compared to conventional methods. The proposed biosensor achieves impressive performance metrics, including a maximum wavelength sensitivity of 125,000 nm/RIU, amplitude sensitivity of −1422.34 RIU ⁻ ¹, resolution of 8 × 10 ⁻ ⁷ RIU, and a figure of merit (FOM) of 2112.15. ML models demonstrated high predictive accuracy for effective index, confinement loss, and amplitude sensitivity. SHAP analysis revealed that wavelength, analyte refractive index, gold thickness, and pitch are the most critical factors influencing sensor performance. The combination of a simple yet efficient design and advanced ML-driven optimization makes this biosensor a promising candidate for high-precision medical diagnostics, particularly cancer cell detection, and chemical sensing applications.",

  "title": "Perceptions regarding making household air pollution a routine topic for health education during antenatal care: A qualitative study in Eastern Uganda",
  "description": "In Uganda, pregnant women do not routinely receive health education during antenatal care regarding exposure to household air pollution (HAP). The study was conducted to explore perceptions regarding what would be needed to incorporate HAP as a routine topic for health education during antenatal care. The study was based on the capability, motivation, opportunity-behavior (COM-B) model. Qualitative interviews were conducted among healthcare workers and pregnant women attending antenatal care at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes. Capability to provide health education on HAP emanated from health system factors (e.g., lack of capacity, workload, time constraints) and behavioral factors (e.g., HAP not seen as a major risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes). Capability to adopt cleaner fuels following health education was thought to be affected by willingness to adopt short-term interventions ahead of cleaner fuels alternatives, cost/affordability constraints, unwillingness to change, and socio-cultural concerns. Socio-economic constraints, weather and safety concerns were thought to affect women’s capability to open doors/windows and cook outdoors following health education. Participants were motivated to provide/receive antenatal health education because of their need to reduce adverse birth outcomes caused by HAP, acceptability of HAP as a topic for education, and the perception of healthcare workers as role models. Training midwives about HAP, using innovative teaching aids, including prompts on HAP in the antenatal card to remind healthcare workers to talk about HAP, giving incentives to healthcare workers and involving them when designing health education about HAP were suggested to enable integration of HAP as routine topic. Our study highlights an opportunity to empower and create demand among pregnant people to adopt behaviors that could reduce exposure to HAP during ANC. Integration of HAP into antenatal care could help transition households from precontemplation and contemplation stage in the uptake of cleaner fuels.",

  "title": "SDC2 and FN as cargo proteins in circulating extracellular vesicles in obese breast cancer patients with lymph node metastasis",
  "description": "Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a pivotal determinant of breast cancer (BC) patient prognosis and treatment efficacy. Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), namely, syndecan-1 (SDC1), SDC2, and SDC4, are involved in cancer progression, metastasis, and regulate extracellular vesicles (EVs) biogenesis, including the microvesicles (MVs). This study analyzed MV-enriched EVs isolated from blood plasma of BC patients with negative (n = 19) and positive (n = 20) LNM (nLNM and pLNM, respectively) using differential centrifugation. Western blot analysis revealed significantly elevated SDC2 levels in MV-enriched EVs from pLNM cases compared to nLNM. Additionally, fibronectin (FN), a SDC2-interacting protein identified through STRING analysis, was also upregulated in pLNM MV-enriched EVs. In contrast, qRT-PCR showed reduced SDC2 (P < 0.01) and FN (P < 0.05) mRNA levels in tumor tissues of pLNM patients compared to nLNM. ROC analysis highlighted the diagnostic value of SDC2 (AUC: 0.8376) and FN (AUC: 0.8803) mRNA in differentiating LNM status. Bioinformatics analyses further confirmed the association of SDC2 and FN expression with BC staging and prognosis. These findings underscore the potential of circulating MV-enriched EV-associated SDC2 and FN, along with their tumor tissue mRNA expression, as potential predictive biomarkers for LNM and chemotherapy response in chemotherapy-naïve obese BC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-17638-2.",

  "title": "Structural equation analysis on the inter-relationships between optimal antenatal care, health facility delivery and early postnatal care among women in Ethiopia: EDHS 2016",
  "description": "AbstractObjectiveThis study employs structural equation modelling to explore the inter-relationships among optimal antenatal care (ANC), health facility delivery and early postnatal care (EPNC) in Ethiopia. By identifying both direct and indirect influencing factors, the study offers valuable insights to support integrated maternal health strategies and guide informed decision-making by policymakers and women alike.DesignThe secondary analysis of the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey 2016 was performed to investigate inter-relationships between optimal ANC, health facility delivery and postnatal care (PNC) among women in Ethiopia. Data were analysed with R software V.4.3.2. The study used binary logistic regression to examine differences in optimal ANC, health facility delivery and EPNC, focusing on variables with a p value of 0.1 or less. Selected variables were incorporated into a generalised structural equation model (GSEM) using the LAVAAN package to explore both direct and indirect effects. The GSEM method assessed the impact of exogenous variables on endogenous variables, all binary, using a logistic link and binomial family. Missing data were handled with the multiple imputation by chained equations package, and sampling weights were applied to ensure national and regional representativeness.Setting and participantThe source population comprised all women of reproductive age (15–49 years) who gave birth in the 5 years preceding the survey. From 16 650 interviewed households (98% response rate), we identified 7590 eligible women with recent births. Finally, we included 2415 women who had attended four or more ANC visits.ResultMedia exposure significantly boosts the likelihood of using ANC (OR=1.8, 95% CI (1.04 to 3.23), p=0.04), health facility delivery (OR=1.7, 95% CI (1.23 to 2.45), p=0.05) and PNC (OR=2.0, 95% CI (1.6 to 4.01), p=0.01). Urban residence and secondary education also enhance ANC (OR=1.2, 95% CI (1.01 to 2.88), p=0.022; OR=1.3, 95% CI (1.20 to 3.01), p=0.018), health facility delivery (OR=1.1, 95% CI (1.01 to 3.24), p=0.035; OR=1.5, 95% CI (1.22 to 3.45), p=0.03) and PNC (OR=1.6, 95% CI (1.01 to 4.32), p=0.03). ANC directly affects health facility delivery (OR=1.4, 95% CI (1.28 to 3.09), p=0.01) and PNC (OR=1.6, 95% CI (1.01 to 3.80), p=0.03). Additionally, women aged 20–34 years and those from male-headed households positively impact health facility delivery (OR=1.5, 95% CI (1.20 to 4.80), p=0.01; OR=1.3, 95% CI (1.07 to 3.45), p=0.014) and PNC (OR=1.4, 95% CI (1.10 to 2.90), p=0.01; OR=1.2, 95% CI (1.07 to 3.08), p=0.025).ConclusionsOptimal ANC is vital for encouraging health facility delivery and EPNC. To enhance maternal and neonatal health, policies should integrate these services. Key predictors include being aged 20–34, having secondary and higher education, media exposure, male-headed households and living in urban areas. Improving education and media exposure can boost maternal healthcare service use.",

  "description": "Methemoglobinemia is a rare but potentially fatal disorder characterized by tissue hypoxia secondary to oxidation of haemoglobin’s ferrous iron (Fe²⁺) to ferric iron (Fe³⁺), which diminishes the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. We report what is, to our knowledge, the first case from India of acquired methemoglobinemia following ingestion of an unregulated online herbal remedy for arthritis, highlighting a rare and under-recognized cause. A 52-year-old male patient developed acute central cyanosis and persistent hypoxia after consuming an online product containing olive oil and salt. Despite high-flow oxygen, saturation levels remained low, and co-oximetry revealed methemoglobinemia (40%). Timely intravenous methylene blue led to a rapid and complete recovery. This case underscores the importance of considering methemoglobinemia in the differential diagnosis of unexplained hypoxia, especially among patients with a history of alternative or unregulated product use, and highlights the need for increased vigilance regarding online supplements in clinical practice.",

  "title": "Incidence and predictors of anemia among children with antiretroviral therapy at health facilities in Southern Ethiopia: A retrospective follow-up study",
  "description": "Objectives:Anemia is a prevalent hematological disorder in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus who are receiving antiretroviral therapy. Anemia is increasingly prevalent among children undergoing antiretroviral treatment; however, studies on the incidence and predictors of anemia in this population within Ethiopia remain limited. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the incidence of anemia and its predictors among children who were enrolled in antiretroviral therapy at health facilities in the Wolaita Zone, South Ethiopia, 2022.Methods:A facility-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 352 medical records at health facilities in the Wolaita Zone from February 2022 to January 2023. The medical records were selected using the stratified cluster sampling method. The data were entered into EpiData and analyzed using STATA version 14. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used. Finally, predictors with p < 0.05 were stated as statistically significant factors. The results were presented using text, tables, and figures.Results:The overall incidence rate of anemia among children was 4.29 (95% confidence interval: 3.46–5.34) per 100 person-years. Being female sex (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.79, 95% confidence interval: 1.29–2.47), advanced disease stage (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.26, 95% confidence interval: 1.26–4.06), a zidovudine-based regimen (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.07, 95% confidence interval: 1.16–3.69), and being stunted (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.37, 95% confidence interval: 2.06–5.50) were the predictors of anemia.Conclusion:The incidence of anemia in the study setting was relatively low. Females, children at advanced World Health Organization clinical stages, those who were stunted, and those who initiated with a zidovudine-based regimen were the predictors of anemia. Healthcare providers should give special attention to children who are at an advanced disease stage, who were stunted, and who are taking a zidovudine-based regimen.",

  "title": "Assessing maternal and newborn health readiness: Insights from a service availability assessment in five provinces in Laos",
  "description": "BackgroundGlobal maternal mortality rates have declined significantly over the past two decades, including an 80% reduction in Laos since 2000. Effective management of obstetric complications – a major contributor to maternal deaths – requires well-staffed facilities equipped with essential supplies, medicines, and infrastructure. Despite progress, Laos still faces gaps in service availability and readiness limiting further reductions in preventable maternal mortality.ObjectiveThis analysis aimed to assess the service availability and readiness of public health facilities in five provinces of Laos to deliver maternal and newborn healthcare, including basic emergency obstetric and newborn care services (BEmONC).MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted In October-November 2023 across 212 health centers and 20 district hospitals under the Laos Maternal Child Health and Nutrition project. Descriptive analysis was used to analyze the data. Service availability was measured based on the number of facilities and beds relative to the population. Service readiness was measured across three domains: guidelines and trained staff, essential equipment and supplies, and essential medicines. A composite readiness score was calculated as the mean across these domains. BEmONC availability was assessed using the presence of seven signal functions.FindingsThe overall service availability score was 71.3% across all provinces. The antenatal care readiness score across both facility types was 69.0%, CI95:62.7–75.3%, with district hospitals scoring higher than health centers, at 77.1%, CI95%:75.4–78.8%, compared to 68.2%, CI95%: 62.1–4.3%. The mean readiness score for delivery and newborn care was 68.3%, CI95%: 59.5–77.1%, with district hospitals again performing better at 81.3%, CI95%:79.7–82.9% compared to 67.0%, CI95%:58.2–75.8% for health centers.ConclusionCritical gaps in maternal and newborn health services remain, particularly in health centers. Investments in staffing, infrastructure, and availability of equipment and medicines is essential to address current gaps, improve service readiness, and contribute to improved quality of care and health outcomes.",

  "title": "Boosting health provider performance with non-financial incentives: A cluster-randomized controlled trial in Tanzania",
  "description": "BackgroundNon-financial incentives are frequently used to improve performance among healthcare providers, capitalizing on mission-driven intrinsic pro-social motivation. However, the effectiveness of incentives varies across settings and may depend on whether they are provided privately or publicly. Using a cluster-randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05525533) among drug shopkeepers in Tanzania, we designed and evaluated the effectiveness of non-financial incentives in boosting provider performance.MethodsWe developed a non-financial incentive that involved providing shopkeepers with monthly reports of aggregated customer feedback compiled from anonymous surveys from young women (15–24) to appeal to shopkeepers’ pro-social motivation for helping these customers. We randomized whether the feedback was provided privately (via a report) or publicly (displaying certificates of the customer feedback ratings). We estimated linear regression models on provider performance as measured by sales across different categories to young women from administrative point-of sales data over 12 months and estimated whether performance measures were correlated with shopkeepers’ pro-social motivation and concern for social image measured by surveys at Baseline.ResultsYoung women customers completed 9,108 anonymous surveys across 99 shops. Shops receiving non-financial incentives privately did not increase performance. However, shops receiving non-financial incentives publicly reported an increase in sales to young women customers (58%, 95% CI: 20%, 97%), most notably for sexual and reproductive health products (96%, 95% CI: 4%, 187%), specifically oral contraception (154%, 95% CI: 9%, 306%) and pregnancy tests (75%, 95% CI: 8%, 143%). Performance measures were correlated with concern for social image but not pro-social motivation at baseline.ConclusionsPublicly provided non-financial incentives increased performance among drug shopkeepers in Tanzania serving young women. Performance was strongest among those with higher concern for their social image at baseline, rather than those with stronger pro-social motivation. Future interventions using non-financial incentives to motivate healthcare providers should consider leveraging providers’ social image concerns to amplify the effectiveness of incentives.",

  "title": "Three-layered semantic framework for public health intelligence",
  "description": "BackgroundDisease surveillance systems play a crucial role in monitoring and preventing infectious diseases. However, the current landscape, primarily focused on fragmented health data, poses challenges to contextual understanding and decision-making. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a semantic framework using ontologies to provide a unified data representation for seamless integration. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach using a case study of a COVID-19 incident at a football game in Italy.MethodIn this study, we undertook a comprehensive approach to gather and analyze data for the development of ontologies within the realm of pandemic intelligence. Multiple ontologies were meticulously crafted to cater to different domains related to pandemic intelligence, such as healthcare systems, mass gatherings, travel, and diseases. The ontologies were classified into top-level, domain, and application layers. This classification facilitated the development of a three-layered architecture, promoting reusability, and consistency in knowledge representation, and serving as the backbone of our semantic framework.ResultThrough the utilization of our semantic framework, we accomplished semantic enrichment of both structured and unstructured data. The integration of data from diverse sources involved mapping to ontology concepts, leading to the creation and storage of RDF triples in the triple store. This process resulted in the construction of linked data, ultimately enhancing the discoverability and accessibility of valuable insights. Furthermore, our anomaly detection algorithm effectively leveraged knowledge graphs extracted from the triple store, employing semantic relationships to discern patterns and anomalies within the data. Notably, this capability was exemplified by the identification of correlations between a football game and a COVID-19 event occurring at the same location and time.ConclusionThe framework showcased its capability to address intricate, multi-domain queries and support diverse levels of detail. Additionally, it demonstrated proficiency in data analysis and visualization, generating graphs that depict patterns and trends; however, challenges related to ontology maintenance, alignment, and mapping must be addressed for the approach’s optimal utilization.",

  "title": "Screening young children for neurodevelopmental differences in sub-Saharan Africa: a scoping review",
  "description": "BackgroundNeurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) present in approximately 10% of children globally. Awareness of NDDs in sub-Saharan Africa is relatively low and little is known about prevalence. This scoping review aims to understand screening of NDDs in young children in sub-Saharan Africa, which NDDs are screened for, and who administers screening.MethodsThe review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR standards for scoping reviews. PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS and PsycInfo were searched according to a defined search strategy with relevant keywords. Studies published in English between 2012 and 2023, where children aged ≥ 2 to < 9 years years, residing in sub-Saharan Africa, were screened for a form of NDD, were included. Due to the flexible nature of a scoping review and its focus on under-explored topics, there were no restrictions on study design. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for selection independently by three researchers and full text articles independently by two researchers. Quality assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.ResultsAfter duplicate removal and title and abstract screening, 546 abstracts were retained for full text review. Twelve publications met the inclusion criteria. These were from South Africa (n = 6), Kenya (n = 3), Uganda (n = 2) and Malawi (n = 1). Only two explicitly screened for multiple NDDs. There was considerable heterogeneity in NDD conceptualisation, study design, screener design, populations of children screened, and persons performing the screening – limiting the possibility for valid comparative analysis. Quality assessment of methodologies yielded ratings ranging from “Very good” to “Unsatisfactory” (cross-sectional studies) and “Good” to “Fair” (cohort- and case-control studies).ConclusionThere are very few published studies on NDD screening in young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Further research examining simple, contextually appropriate screening for a wide range of NDDs amongst this group, is needed. This may inform future screening programmes, policy development and clinical practice throughout the region.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12888-025-07279-0.",

  "title": "Serum Metabolomics of Patients with Hepatic Cystic Echinococcosis",
  "description": "ABSTRACTHepatic cystic echinococcosis (HCE), a liver manifestation of hydatid disease, is among the 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) prioritized by the WHO for eradication by 2025. Although imaging and serological tests are currently the main diagnostic approaches for HCE, they have notable limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Here, we applied liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS)–based metabolomic profiling to uncover differential metabolites and highlight disrupted metabolic pathways, aiming to identify candidate biomarkers for HCE diagnosis. Ten patients diagnosed with HCE were enrolled in the case group. Thirteen healthy individuals were included as controls. Serum metabolomic profiling was performed using LC‐MS/MS. Differences in metabolite profiles between the two groups were analyzed employing both univariate and multivariate statistical methods. A total of 20 differential metabolites were significantly altered in the HCE group compared to the controls (p < 0.05, VIP > 1.0). Pathway and enrichment analyses revealed that these metabolites were mainly involved in 8 metabolic pathways, suggesting their potential as candidate biomarkers for HCE diagnosis. These findings enhance our understanding of the metabolic alterations associated with HCE and provide a foundation for further investigation into the disease's pathogenesis and the development of metabolite‐based diagnostic tools.",

  "title": "Aspects of Genetic Diversity, Host Specificity and Public Health Significance of Single‐Celled Intestinal Parasites Commonly Observed in Humans and Mostly Referred to as ‘Non‐Pathogenic’",
  "description": "ABSTRACTClinical microbiology involves the detection and differentiation of primarily bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi in patients with infections. Billions of people may be colonised by one or more species of common luminal intestinal parasitic protists (CLIPPs) that are often detected in clinical microbiology laboratories; still, our knowledge on these organisms' impact on global health is very limited. The genera Blastocystis, Dientamoeba, Entamoeba, Endolimax and Iodamoeba comprise CLIPPs species, the life cycles of which, as opposed to single‐celled pathogenic intestinal parasites (e.g., microsporidia and sporozoa), do probably not include gut‐invasive stages that could result in pathological processes and thereby disease (except for Entamoeba histolytica). All five genera are parasites in the sense that they use a host to complete their life cycle; still, by many specialists, these are considered to be of limited clinical relevance and could possibly be referred to as ‘eukaryotic endobionts’ or even ‘endosymbionts’, in case they would have health‐protective effects. The articles included in this thesis exemplify the work and the data that support the view that it might be more relevant to study these genera in a public health and gut ecology context than in a clinical microbiology context. Essential to investigating the impact of intestinal parasites on health and disease are accurate diagnostic tools, including DNA‐based technology such as PCR and sequencing, plus accurate reference databases. Small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes consistently present in both pro‐ and eukaryotic organisms are today avidly used as taxonomic markers. DNA‐based methods have been developed for genetic characterisation of microorganisms and provided data on species/subtypes/genotypes, etc. Metagenomics and metabarcoding (the use of low‐specific PCR coupled with next‐generation sequencing) can provide information on co‐infection/co‐colonisation with other organisms and enable screening for genetic diversity, even in complex matrices. By developing and implementing sensitive and specific DNA‐based diagnostic tools and typing assays primarily based on the SSU rRNA gene, we have increased insight into the diversity, distribution and significance of CLIPPs. With these tools, we have shown that the genera Blastocystis and Dientamoeba are far more common than previously thought. Only 10–15 years ago, hypotheses on their distribution typically relied on data generated by traditional parasitological diagnostic methods, such as light microscopy. Hence, we have shown that most older children in Nigeria host Blastocystis, and that most children in day‐care institutions in Denmark, if not all, get colonised by Dientamoeba at some point. Single‐celled non‐pathogenic intestinal parasites can be hosted by patients with diarrhoea and functional or inflammatory bowel diseases. However, emerging data appear to suggest that CLIPPs are generally more common in gut‐healthy individuals than in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. The research we have carried out on associations between CLIPPs and gut bacteria suggests that colonisation with these parasites is seen primarily in individuals with a healthy ‘gut flora’ (eubiosis). This observation should prompt future research projects focusing on the use of CLIPPs as biomarkers, and it should be investigated to which extent manipulation with CLIPPs could lead to changes in the gut flora and thereby be used as probiotics. In the event that it makes sense to speak of ‘infection’ by CLIPPs, we still lack tools to differentiate between colonisation and infection. We have known for decades that morphologically similar parasites can differ in terms of clinical impact and be genetically distinct, a feature that we refer to as ‘cryptic genetic diversity’. One example is E. histolytica, which cannot be differentiated from Entamoeba dispar by cyst morphological features. However, whereas E. histolytica can be invasive and give rise to amoebic dysentery and amoebiasis, E. dispar is by most specialists considered non‐invasive and generally non‐pathogenic. This insight led us to investigate genetic diversity among other species of Entamoeba as well as other CLIPPs genera. If we could demonstrate similar—or higher—degrees of diversity within Blastocystis, Dientamoeba, Endolimax and Iodamoeba, these differences might be key to explaining differences in parasite phenotype and thereby differences in the ability of the parasites to cause symptoms. Despite the disclosure of striking genetic diversity among some CLIPPs, we have found little support for such theories; however, more studies are needed. As for Dientamoeba, we have observed a more or less clonal expansion of one of the two genotypes known to exist, and this genotype appears to have global predominance. In contrast, extensive genetic diversity is observed between and within subtypes of Blastocystis: to date, more than 30 species, the so‐called subtypes, have been acknowledged. We, and many others, have sought to identify whether one or more of these subtypes could be linked to the development of intestinal symptoms, but there is little evidence to support this hypothesis. We know that Subtypes 1–4 reflect about 95% of Blastocystis colonisation in humans, and we have shown that individuals with zoonotic subtypes (e.g., ST6, ST7 and ST8) might typically experience symptoms. We have disclosed astonishing genetic variation among other CLIPPs, which has led to the recognition of Iodamoeba bütschlii, Endolimax nana, Entamoeba coli and Entamoeba hartmanni as species complexes, where each species should be regarded as a complex of species (referred to as ‘subtypes’ or ‘ribosomal lineages’) with overlapping morphology. And where E. histolytica and E. dispar differ by only 1%–2% diversity across the SSU rRNA gene, we have observed up to at least 10% and 30% genetic difference among ribosomal lineages within E. coli and I. bütschlii, respectively, challenging species concepts currently applied. Our research has resulted in the recognition of three ribosomal lineages within both E. coli and E. hartmanni, as well as two ribosomal lineages of E. nana and I. bütschlii. Moreover, we have discovered a new lineage of Entamoeba moshkovskii. Molecular characterisation of intestinal parasites collected from different host species (humans, non‐human primates, other mammals, birds, etc.) can help identify opportunity for transmission between human and non‐human hosts. We have shown that pigs can host a few species/lineages that can readily colonise humans, such as Entamoeba hartmanni and I. bütschlii. Many other species of larger mammals are common hosts of Blastocystis and Entamoeba. However, for the two latter genera, the species/genetic variants observed in non‐human hosts are typically different from those observed in humans, which could indicate that many species of CLIPPs have adapted to their respective hosts over a long period, resulting in relatively high host specificity. For Blastocystis, we have shown that even though a given subtype may be found in more than one host species, it is possible to demonstrate cryptic host specificity at allele level. For instance, even though both human and non‐human primates can be colonised by ST3, host species‐specific strains of ST3 circulate within these two host populations. With regards to E. coli, it is possible that ST1 has adapted to human hosts, while E. coli ST2 has adapted to a broader host range, including non‐human primates and rodents. It has become clear that CLIPPs are common colonisers of the human background population, and even though we cannot disprove the existence of infection by any of these, it should be reasonable to consider clinical and medical intervention redundant in most cases. Perhaps it might even be so that one should try not to eradicate these organisms from the gut when first established. However, more studies are warranted to elucidate the significance of the pronounced genetic diversity observed in some CLIPPs with regards to transmission patterns and clinical significance. Future research in CLIPPs should also include studies that can elucidate those factors that favour colonisation with CLIPPs and what role CLIPPs have in host–gut ecology, metabolism and overall health condition. Finally, as human and non‐human hosts share these parasitic genera, and as some protozoa possibly contribute to overall gut function in ruminants, it would be interesting to study these in domesticated and wild animals to learn more about the role of these parasites in health and disease, including investigations into whether some CLIPPs might be endosymbionts.",

  "title": "Prevalence and factors influencing drug-resistant tuberculosis in four regions of Ghana",
  "description": "IntroductionThe alarming rate of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) globally is a threat to treatment success among positive tuberculosis (TB) cases. Studies aimed at determining the prevalence, trend of DR-TB and socio-demographic and clinical risk factors contributing to DR-TB in the four regions of Ghana are currently unknown. This study sought to determine the prevalence and trend of DR-TB, identify socio-demographic and clinical risk factors that influence DR-TB, and analyse the relationship between underweight and adverse drug reactions and treatment outcomes among DR-TB patients in four regions of Ghana.MethodIt was a retrospective review conducted over 5 years, from January 2018 to the end of December 2022. The data were retrieved from the DR-TB registers and folders at the Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) centres in the four regions. Analysis of the data was conducted using STATA version 17.ResultsThe prevalence of DR-TB in Ashanti was 10.1%, Eastern 5.3%, 27.8% in Central, and 2.7% in the Upper West region for the year 2022. The overall prevalence rate of DR-TB for the period 2018–2022 was 13.8%. The socio-demographic and clinical risk factors that influence DR-TB in the four regions are: age, marital status (aOR 3.58, P-value< 0.00, 95% CI 2.86–4.48), Senior High School (SHS) level of education (aOR 2.09, P-value = 0.01, 95% CI 1.21–3.63), alcohol intake (aOR 0.49, P-value <0.00, 95% CI 0.38–0.63), previously treated (aOR 22.03, P-value<0.00, CI 16.58–29.26), major adverse drug reaction (aOR 125.50, P-value<0.00, 95% CI 58.05–271.34), and minor adverse drug reaction (aOR 23.59, P-value<0.00, 95% CI 18.32–30.39); treatment outcome, cure (aOR 0.52, P-value<0.00, 95% CI 0.41–0.66), completed (aOR 9.67, P-value<0.00, 95% CI 6.56–14.28), relapsed (aOR 2.62, P-value = 0.01, 95% CI 1.33–5.18), Lost-to-Follow-up (LTFU) (aOR 0.45, P-value<0.00, 95% CI 0.29–0.70), and failure (aOR 35.24, P-value<0.00, 95% CI 7.76–159.99). Also, there was an association between underweight and adverse drug reaction (RRR 5.74, P-value<0.00, 95% CI 4.86–6.79) and treatment outcome (RRR 0.79, P-value<0.00, 95% CI 0.74–0.86).ConclusionThe study shows that the prevalence of DR-TB in Ghana is low, probably not because the cases have reduced but due to inadequate GeneXpert machines to detect the cases. Age, marital status, education, alcohol intake, previously treated TB cases, adverse drug reactions, underweight, and treatment outcome are factors influencing the development of DR-TB. Therefore, interventions aimed at improving the nutritional status of DR-TB cases and minimising adverse drug reactions will improve treatment outcomes.",

  "title": "Improving Management of Viral Febrile Illness and Reducing the Need for Empiric Antibiotics Using VIDAS® Immunoassay for Dengue and Chikungunya: A West African Multicentric Study",
  "description": "Background: Dengue and chikungunya are endemic in West Africa, posing significant public health issues. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of differential and systematic diagnosis of dengue and chikungunya on patient management and on antibiotic use in Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast. Methods: A multicenter prospective cohort study was conducted in both countries involving patients with suspected dengue and/or chikungunya viremia. VIDAS® diagnostic tests (bioMérieux SA, Marcy-l’Étoile, France) were provided to the intervention sites, while the control sites initially followed standard of care before testing at the end of the study. The primary outcome was defined as antibiotic prescription or non-initiation/discontinuation, and the secondary endpoints included hospital resource use, patient satisfaction, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), analyzed through Chi-square and logistic regression using SAS software v9.4. Results: Out of 775 enrolled patients, 767 had corresponding VIDAS® Dengue and VIDAS® Chikungunya results, with 570 having recorded antibiotic therapy (initiated, non-initiated or discontinued). Both Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast observed an increase in antibiotic discontinuation (or non-initiation) rates at the intervention sites compared to control sites: increased from 60% to 78% in Burkina Faso and from 36% to 83% in Ivory Coast. Hospitalization rates within seven days following inclusion were also lower in intervention sites than in the control sites: Burkina Faso 41% as compared with 97% and Ivory Coast 24% as compared with 98%. Patient-reported antibiotic use within seven days post-inclusion was also significantly lower in intervention sites. Conclusions: The results showed a reduction in potential antibiotic overuse and hospital admissions (i.e., hospitalization rates within seven days) in both the Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast interventions sites. These findings emphasize the importance of enhanced diagnostic strategies for the improvement of patient outcomes and the fight against antibiotic resistance. This study also highlights the need for implementing systematic and differential diagnosis of dengue and chikungunya in West Africa where febrile infections are endemic. Further studies are warranted to explore the economic benefits of these diagnostic strategies.",

  "title": "Digitizing HIV care in Uganda: Patient and provider perspectives on the AmFine patient portal",
  "description": "BackgroundIn resource-limited settings like Uganda, managing HIV care through conventional paper-based systems poses challenges such as inefficiencies in clinical workflows and limited patient engagement. The AmFine patient portal and mobile application was developed to digitize the paper-based “blue card” system and enhance patient-provider communication.ObjectiveTo explore the lived experiences of patients and healthcare providers in using the AmFine patient portal and mobile application at the immune suppressive syndrome (ISS) Clinic of Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, focusing on usability, motivation for use, challenges and suggestions for improvement.MethodsWe conducted face-to-face in-depth interviews with 25 participants (21 patients and 4 healthcare providers) at the ISS Clinic of Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital between April 2023 and May 2023. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using codebook thematic analysis guided by Braun and Clarke's approach. Coding was conducted in NVivo 12, and themes were developed inductively to explore participant experiences, perceived usability, and challenges of the AmFine patient portal and mobile application.ResultsThe AmFine patient portal and mobile application was positively perceived as enhancing communication and convenience. Patients appreciated the ability to send messages to providers without traveling to the clinic, fostering privacy and reducing stigma. Providers valued streamlined patient management and communication. Challenges included limited technological literacy among some patients, intermittent internet connectivity, and data costs. Suggestions for improvement included enhancing offline functionality, diversifying language options, and providing more detailed training sessions.ConclusionsThe AmFine patient portal and mobile application demonstrated potential to improve HIV care delivery and patient engagement in a resource-limited setting. Addressing identified challenges can optimize system usability and adoption.",

  "title": "From Mushrooms to Molecules: Exploring Depsidones in Ganoderma lucidum for Antioxidant and Anticancer Applications",
  "description": "Fungi are a prolific source of diverse bioactive metabolites, yet many remain unexplored. Among these, depsidones are a rare class of compounds with significant biological potential, but they are seldom reported in mushrooms. This study investigated the medicinal fungus Ganoderma lucidum, known for its extensive therapeutic use in traditional medicine. Fruiting bodies were extracted using petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and methanol. Extracts were screened phytochemically and assessed for total phenolic content and antioxidant activity using the DPPH assay. Ethyl acetate extract exhibited the highest phenolic yield and antioxidant potential and was subsequently evaluated for cytotoxicity against HepG2, HCT116, MCF7, and A549 cancer cell lines. It showed notable anticancer activity with minimal toxicity to normal Vero cells. UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis of G. lucidum ethyl acetate extract tentatively identified nine minor depsidones including mollicellin G, simplicildone I, mollicellin B, talaromyone B, simplicildone A, purpactin C, emeguisin B, mollicellin E, and simplicildone D on the basis of high-resolution negative-mode detection and characteristic MS/MS fragmentation patterns. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between these compounds and cancer-related targets (AKT1, CDK2, ERK1, TNFα), with simplicildone D and mollicellin G demonstrating particularly high interactions. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the observed bioactivity and highlight G. lucidum as a promising source of therapeutic depsidones for future anticancer drug development.",

  "title": "Patterns of Morbidity in Ambatoboeny District, Northern Madagascar: A 12-Month Study",
  "description": "Background: Ambatoboeny District in northern Madagascar faces significant health challenges due to widespread poverty, poor access to healthcare, and limited diagnostic capabilities. Despite high disease burden, data on morbidity patterns in the region are scarce. This study aims to identify the most prevalent diseases and most affected demographic groups, thus providing valuable insight into the region’s health profile. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on medical records from 3678 patients who were admitted at Clinique Médicale BEYZYM, a secondary-level referral facility in Manerinerina, Boeny Region between January and December 2024. Diagnoses were retrieved from physician registration ledgers, hospitalization records, monthly laboratory reports, monthly general hospital activity reports and monthly reports from Centre de Traitement et de Diagnostic de la Tuberculose, which were cross-referenced and verified by trained clinical staff. Records were included if they contained identifiable demographic data and at least one clinical diagnosis. Diagnoses were coded using ICD-11 and were classified into 15 major categories. Results: The median patient age was 19.5 years (IQR: 7–42), with females accounting for 54% of the cohort. Most patients (87.2%) resided in Ambatoboeny. The most common reasons for admission were infectious and parasitic diseases (35.75%, 95% CI: 34.20–37.30), respiratory diseases (22.73%, 95% CI: 21.38–24.08), and diseases of the genitourinary system (13.95%, 95% CI: 12.83–15.07), collectively accounting for 72.43% of all recorded cases. Statistically significant differences in morbidity patterns were observed across age and sex groups. Conclusions: The findings underscore the multifaceted burden of disease in the Ambatoboeny District, where both infectious and chronic conditions coexist in a resource-limited setting. Delayed healthcare-seeking behavior, cultural beliefs, and diagnostic limitations further complicate care delivery. This study provides foundational data to inform targeted health policies, humanitarian medical missions, and diagnostic capacity-building tailored to local needs.",

  "title": "Positive allosteric modulation of emodepside sensitive Brugia malayi SLO-1F and Onchocerca volvulus SLO-1A potassium channels by GoSlo-SR-5-69",
  "description": "Human lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis are Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), of major public health concern. Prophylaxis and treatment rely on anthelmintics that effectively eliminate migrating microfilariae but lack efficacy against adult filarial worms. To expedite the elimination of both diseases, drugs with adulticidal activity are needed. The broad-spectrum anthelmintic emodepside, a nematode selective SLO-1 K channel activator, is a promising candidate for the treatment of onchocerciasis due to its macrofilaricidal activity against Onchocerca volvulus. Nevertheless, it is less effective against adult Brugia malayi, one of the causative agents of human lymphatic filariasis. Characterizing molecular and pharmacological disparities between highly conserved splice variant isoforms of B. malayi and O. volvulus SLO-1 K channels and identifying allosteric modulators that can increase emodepside potency on B. malayi SLO-1 K channels is necessary for therapeutic advance. In this study, we tested the effects of emodepside and the mammalian BK channel activator, GoSlo-SR-5–69 alone and in combination on Xenopus expressed B. malayi SLO-1F and O. volvulus SLO-1A channels. Additionally, binding poses of emodepside, and GoSlo-SR-5–69 were predicted on both channels using molecular docking. We observed that Ovo-SLO-1A was more sensitive to emodepside than Bma-SLO-1F, with EC50 values of 0.40 ± 0.05 µM and 1.4 ± 0.2 µM for Ovo-SLO-1A and Bma-SLO-1F respectively. GoSlo-SR-5–69 lacked agonist activity on both channel isoforms but acted as a positive allosteric modulator, potentiating the effects of emodepside. Molecular docking analysis revealed that emodepside binds at the S6 pocket below the selectivity filter for Bma-SLO-1F and Ovo-SLO-1A. In contrast, GoSlo-SR-5–69 binds at the RCK1 pocket. This study reveals for the first time, allosteric modulation of filarial nematode SLO-1 K channels by a mammalian BK channel activator and highlights its ability to increase emodepside potency on the B. malayi SLO-1 K channel.",

  "description": "Objectives:Sickle cell trait (SCT) is the carrier status for sickle cell disease, and people with SCT have both hemoglobin A (HbA) and sickling hemoglobin (HbS). SCT is generally regarded as a benign condition, but clinical complications can be substantial. No registry or surveillance system exists to track health outcomes for people with SCT; this study aimed to identify methodology for surveillance.Methods:This longitudinal analysis included all live births with SCT identified by the California Department of Public Health Newborn Screening (NBS) Program from 1991 through 2013 and 3 matched controls per newborn, linked to death data in California for 1991-2013.Results:There were 94 240 live births with SCT and 282 720 matched healthy controls; 693 (0.74%) deaths occurred in the SCT group, and 1910 (0.68%) deaths occurred among the matched controls. Those with SCT had an increased mortality hazard ratio (MHR) compared with matched controls (11% higher; P = .02). When stratified, the MHR was higher among those aged 1 to 4 years (44% higher; P < .001) and 5 to 14 years (48% higher; P = .005) than among the matched controls. Examination of causes of death showed only a slightly higher-than-expected risk of death due to respiratory causes among people with SCT.Conclusions:These findings highlight the need for population-level research, including investigation into causes of death, to inform clinical management and counseling for SCT. Other states may replicate this methodology with population-based data sources. Further surveillance of the health of those with SCT is needed.",

  "title": "In silico biophysics and rheology of blood and red blood cells in Gaucher Disease",
  "description": "Gaucher Disease (GD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, leading to the accumulation of glucosylceramide in various cells, including red blood cells (RBCs). This accumulation results in altered biomechanical properties and rheological behavior of RBCs, which may play an important role in blood rheology and the development of bone infarcts, avascular necrosis (AVN) and other bone diseases associated with GD. In this study, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations are employed to investigate the biomechanics and rheology of blood and RBCs in GD under various flow conditions. The model incorporates the unique characteristics of GD RBCs, such as decreased deformability and increased aggregation properties, and aims to capture the resulting changes in RBC biophysics and blood viscosity. This study is the first to explore the Young’s modulus and aggregation parameters of GD RBCs by validating simulations with confocal imaging and experimental RBC disaggregation thresholds. Through in silico simulations, we examine the impact of hematocrit, RBC disaggregation threshold, and cell stiffness on blood viscosity in GD. The results reveal three distinct domains of GD blood viscosity based on shear rate: the aggregation domain, where the RBC disaggregation threshold predominantly influences blood viscosity; the transition area, where both RBC aggregation and stiffness impact on blood viscosity; and the stiffness domain, where the stiffness of RBCs emerges as the primary determinant of blood viscosity. By analyzing RBC mechanical properties and blood viscosity in relation to bone disease, we find that the RBC aggregation properties, deformability, and blood viscosity, may contribute to its onset. These findings enhance our understanding of how changes in RBC properties impact on blood viscosity and may affect bone health, offering a partial explanation for the bone complications observed in GD patients.",

  "title": "Principles of the Africa health workforce investment charter to stimulate sustainable health workforce investments",
  "description": "Despite improvements in health workforce density, the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region Member States an additional 6.1 million additional health workers by 2030 to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) and health sustainable development goals (SDGs) targets and ensure health security. Additional investments are needed for their education, employment, and retention. However, most countries cannot meet this and require support to secure increased sustainable long-term domestic and external investments in the health workforce to strengthen health systems as part of broader health and national development efforts to improve health, economic, and social outcomes. The Africa Health Workforce Investment Charter, launched by the WHO Africa Regional Office in May 2024, outlines a set of key principles that countries can adapt to stimulate and secure the multisectoral domestic and external investments needed to reduce Africa’s health workforce shortages by 2030. This would ultimately increase access and availability of health care workers and primary healthcare services, especially in rural and underserved communities. The Investment Charter sets out the following key principles for coordinating and sustaining investments in education, employment, retention, and public health functions: (1) Enabling government leadership and stewardship; (2) Applying evidence-informed prioritisation investment; (3) Aligning multisectoral investments through partnership and collaboration; (4) Stimulating more and better investments; and (5) Securing sustainable health workforce investments.",

  "title": "A Mesoporous Silica-Based Naringenin Delivery System Promoting Macrophage M2 Polarization in Atherosclerosis",
  "description": "Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of global cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with inflammatory and immunological mechanisms. Immunotherapy has demonstrated promising efficacy in the management of atherosclerosis. Nevertheless, certain immunotherapeutic approaches are associated with limitations, including suboptimal efficacy and non-negligible adverse effects. Upon the pivotal role of macrophage phenotypes in atherosclerosis progression, naringenin-loaded manganese-doped mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MMSN@NAR) were designed and synthesized to reprogram M1 macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, thereby offering a potential therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis treatment. High loading capacity of naringenin was achieved in MMSN carriers, with superior biocompatibility profiles compared to naringenin dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, while maintaining pH-dependent release behavior as demonstrated by dialysis assays. MMSN@NAR is preferentially phagocytosed by M1 macrophages, attenuates inflammatory responses, protects against oxidative stress, and promotes M2 polarization via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in vitro. In the ApoE−/− mouse unilateral carotid artery ligation model of atherosclerosis, MMSN@NAR demonstrated marked accumulation in plaques and excellent biocompatibility. Compared to using naringenin or MMSN alone, it could further reduce plaque area by approximately 40% or 60% by inducing macrophage phenotype transformation, which was confirmed by section staining and immunofluorescence. Collectively, this study highlights enhanced macrophage M2 polarization inhibiting atherosclerosis by MMSN@NAR as a promising nanoplatform, offering a novel therapeutic approach based on anti-inflammatory immune regulation.",

  "title": "Health facility and contextual correlates of HIV test positivity: a multilevel model of routine programmatic data from Malawi",
  "description": "AbstractBackgroundInnovative and efficient methods are needed to identify remaining people living with HIV unaware of their status. Routine health information system (RHIS) data, widely available in high-burden HIV settings, may help target areas of high risk to deliver timely prevention services. Often underused, RHIS data were leveraged at the facility level to predict changes in HIV test positivity in Malawi.MethodsFrom District Health Information Software-2 from January 2017 to March 2023, we analysed sexually transmitted infection (STI) cases and HIV tests and test results across 563 health facilities in Malawi. A multilevel model was employed to determine whether changes in STI diagnoses were predictive of changes in HIV test positivity. We considered STI types and their incubation periods, and controlled for facility type, ownership, quarter, season, zonal HIV and STI prevalence (2016 Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment).ResultsAmong 139 million HIV tests, overall positivity was 2.8%. Blantyre facilities had the highest positivity (6.0%) while those in the central-east zone had the lowest (1.8%). Key variables—changes in syndromic STI counts (lagged and cross-sectional)—showed weak or no associations with HIV positivity (OR: 1.01, CI: 1.01 to 1.01; OR: 1.00, CI: 1.00 to 1.00). However, contextual covariates, including zonal HIV prevalence (OR: 1.04, CI: 1.04 to 1.04), genital ulcers (OR: 1.16, CI: 1.16 to 1.16) and clinical STI diagnoses (OR: 1.29, CI: 1.29 to 1.29), were positively associated with HIV positivity.ConclusionsIn settings with high STI screening uptake, RHIS data can be used to monitor changes in STI diagnoses and contextual factors to identify HIV hotspots and guide targeted testing, prevention and treatment services.",

  "title": "Advancing the Lusaka Agenda: the Global Financing Facility’s missed opportunities for catalysing sustainable health investment",
  "description": "ABSTRACTThis Commentary is part of the Global Health Action Special Issue titled Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents: Examining National Priorities, Processes and Investments. The Issue examines the Global Financing Facility (GFF) through the lens of nine papers that explore the content and development processes of GFF country documents. While the GFF achieved technical alignment with national reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health priorities, it did not consistently translate into the mobilization of increased domestic resources. Loan-heavy financing structures substituted, rather than supplemented, public spending and intensified fiscal pressure in debt-constrained contexts. The expansion of results-based financing models has brought additional sustainability and equity concerns, with many initiatives collapsing post-project due to inadequate alignment with public finance systems. This falls short of the Lusaka Agenda’s strategic shift towards country-led sustainable financing. Stakeholder engagement, particularly in civil society organizations, is often late, limited, or superficial. The neglect of stillbirth and respectful maternity care in the GFF documents calls for a critical look at high impact underprioritized areas when making future GFF investment decisions. As global health aid retracts and low- and middle-income countries navigate debt pressures, global health initiatives must base investments in disease burden data and engage stakeholders meaningfully. To realize the Lusaka Agenda’s vision, the GFF must align with national public finance systems and secure sustainability beyond donor cycles.",

  "title": "Exploration of the social determinants of diarrhoea, rotavirus vaccine uptake, and vaccine ‘fatigue’ in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi",
  "description": "Diarrhoea due to rotavirus remains a significant cause of child mortality in developing regions. Caregivers’ perspectives on the social determinants of gastroenteritis and childhood vaccination, including the rotavirus vaccine, were explored through focus group discussions in Ethiopia (n = 6), Kenya (n = 14), and Malawi (n = 10), using a combination of thematic and framework analysis approaches. The results show that diarrhoea was perceived to be a burden in all three countries, particularly among infants, due to challenges in WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) infrastructures and poverty. Prevention strategies mentioned by the caregivers focussed on enhancing WASH interventions without mention of vaccination. Participants however expressed a lack of agency to address WASH at community level in informal settlements where the studies were conducted. Antibiotics were seen as “strong medications” and often purchased without prescription for treatment of diarrhoea, raising concerns on Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR), while home remedies such as rice porridge were used for less severe diarrhoea symptoms. Perceived or experiential benefits and safety of previous vaccines promoted vaccine uptake in all three countries. On the other hand, limited understanding of vaccines, concerns about side effects, perceived excessive vaccination, mistrust of vaccines or suspicions of existing vaccines undermined individuals’ willingness to vaccinate children. Our results highlight that a lack of attention to socio-determinants of poor health in contexts where there are several vaccines and yet a high incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases may undermine vaccine confidence. Multi-sectoral interventions to tackle social determinants of diarrhoea and improve community understanding of vaccines are required to improve overall community health outcomes.",

  "title": "Dengue Epidemiology in 7 Southeast Asian Countries: 24-Year, Retrospective, Multicountry Ecological Study",
  "description": "AbstractBackgroundDengue fever remains the most significant vector-borne disease in Southeast Asia, imposing a substantial burden on public health systems. Global warming and increased international mobility may exacerbate the disease’s prevalence. Furthermore, the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced the epidemiological patterns of dengue.ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate epidemiological changes in dengue incidence in Southeast Asia.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective, multicountry ecological study analyzing trends in dengue incidence in 7 Southeast Asian countries from January 2000 to December 2023. Data were extracted from official World Health Organization reports and national health department databases. Countries with data that were incomplete, inconsistent, or not publicly available were excluded from the final analysis. Annual incidence rates were analyzed, and linear trends were calculated to assess long-term patterns.ResultsEpidemiological data from 7 Southeast Asian countries, comprising Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Cambodia, and Taiwan, were analyzed across the 24-year study period. A notable nadir in dengue cases was observed coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant increasing trends in dengue incidence were identified in Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines (slopes: 8.243, 6.513, 8.737, and 8.172; R2 values: 0.14, 0.34, 0.345, and 0.46, respectively, all P<.05).ConclusionsDengue fever continues to pose a significant public health challenge in Southeast Asia. Our analysis demonstrates a substantial increase in dengue cases in several countries over the study period. While a temporary decline was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, a subsequent resurgence of cases highlights the persistent threat of dengue in the region. These findings underscore the critical need for sustained surveillance and innovative control strategies to mitigate the impact of dengue in Southeast Asia.",

  "description": "Background/Objectives: Hemoglobinopathies, including thalassemia and sickle cell disease, are among the most common inherited disorders worldwide. This study aimed to profile hemoglobin variants in the Tharu community of Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh, with particular focus on the rare variant Hb J-Meerut [α 120 (H3) Ala→Glu (α1)]. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during a community health camp in February 2024. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 505 individuals, of which 445 were analyzed using complete blood count (CBC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Suspected variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Hemoglobinopathies were identified in nearly one-fifth of participants. The major variants detected were sickle cell trait, β-thalassemia trait, and Hb J-Meerut. Sequencing confirmed Hb J-Meerut in the majority of suspected cases. HPLC profiles showed clear differences between groups, supporting its role as a reliable screening tool. Conclusions: Community-based screening combining HPLC and sequencing provides an effective approach for identifying both common and rare hemoglobin variants. Early detection of silent carriers such as Hb J-Meerut is essential for targeted genetic counseling and preventive strategies in high-risk populations.",

  "description": "ABSTRACTEpstein‐Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma‐associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are oncogenic human gammaherpesviruses (GHVs) associated with a broad spectrum of malignancies and chronic diseases. However, direct studies of these viruses in humans are limited by ethical constraints, technical challenges, and their strict species specificity. To overcome these barriers, researchers have developed surrogate models, with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) emerging as a tractable and widely utilized system. MHV68 shares key genetic and biological features with EBV and KSHV, providing critical insights into GHV pathogenesis, including viral latency, reactivation, immune evasion, and virus‐host interactions. This review summarizes current cellular and animal models for GHV research, highlighting the advantages and limitations of MHV68 as a model for studying human GHVs. We explore mechanisms of viral gene function, immune modulation, and host responses, and discuss how these models have advanced our understanding of GHV‐associated diseases. Improved model systems will be essential for guiding future experimental approaches and developing targeted therapies for GHV‐driven malignancies and other related disorders.",

  "description": "AbstractBackgroundThe global penetration of mobile phones has offered novel opportunities for communicating health-related information to individuals. A low-cost system that facilitates autonomous communication with individuals via mobile phones holds potential for expanding the reach of health messaging in settings with human resource and infrastructure limitations.ObjectiveWe sought to design a flexible, low-code system using open-source software that could be adapted to different contexts and technical environments and accommodate a wide range of automation needs. We report on key details of the mobile phone–based appointment reminder and incentive system (mParis), document its use, review implementation challenges and adaptations to address these challenges in the context of a quasi-randomized trial of mobile phone–based reminders and incentives as means of increasing the timeliness of childhood vaccinations in Tanzania, and outline other use cases that highlight the versatility of the system.MethodsThe mParis instance described in this paper, which is hosted in Tanzania, sent automated, individualized vaccination reminders in the form of SMS text messages to the mobile phones of mothers of young children. Process workflows, based on the national vaccination schedule of Tanzania, were programmed into mParis. Reminders for vaccinations due at ages 6, 10, and 14 weeks were sent 7 days and 1 day before and 14 days after each vaccination due date. A subset of messages included financial incentive offers to mothers for the timely vaccination of their children. We report on implementation outcomes, challenges, and adaptations to address these challenges.ResultsBetween August and December 2017, a total of 412 pregnant women were enrolled in the trial. After mothers reported the birth of their children, individualized vaccination reminder messages were sent for vaccination due dates between January and July 2018. From March 2018, messages contained financial incentive offers. Of 1397 messages sent, 1122 (80.3%) messages were recorded as delivered, 249 (18.8%) as expired and resent; 23 (1.6%) as failed, and 3 (0.2%) as sent but lacking a delivery confirmation. In total, 633 (45.3%) messages contained incentive offers. Of 173 women who received at least 1 message, 67 (38.7%) were sent reminders only; 106 (61.3%) women were sent at least 1 incentivized message. Numerous challenges were encountered during the system’s implementation, despite its deliberate design to accommodate basic problems, such as intermittent internet access and power failures. Continuous adaptation to increase the resilience of the system resulted in a successful deployment.ConclusionsmParis’ open-source nature, auditability, and ability to autonomously execute algorithms in a low-resource setting with frequent infrastructure challenges suggest favorable prospects to automate health communication in a wide range of settings. mParis’ use in other applications, including enrollment and follow-up for health-related research studies, demonstrates its versatility and ability to accommodate diverse challenges that may be encountered.",

  "description": "ABSTRACTAimsSustained neuroinflammation following ischemic stroke impedes post‐injury tissue repairment and neurological functional recovery. Developing innovative therapeutic strategies that simultaneously suppress detrimental inflammatory cascades and facilitate neurorestorative processes is critical for improving long‐term rehabilitation outcomes.MethodsWe employed a microglia depletion‐repopulation paradigm by administering PLX5622 for 7 days post‐ischemia; followed by a 7‐day withdrawal period to allow microglia repopulation. Single‐cell transcriptomics, behavioral testing, cytokine arrays, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence were used to assess the effects of microglia repopulation and delineate the transition of reshaped immune microenvironment.ResultsPLX5622 administration reshaped the poststroke immune microenvironment, promoting neurofunctional recovery. Repopulated microglia adopted a homeostatic phenotype, increasing homeostatic states by ~14.36% and reducing pro‐inflammatory states by ~20.17%. This reshaped environment suppressed T cell exhaustion, limited neutrophil terminal differentiation, and promoted a phagocytic macrophage phenotype. Furthermore, we identified that these transitions in infiltrating immune cells may be driven by reduced chemokine production, enhanced blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and transcriptional reprogramming.ConclusionTransient microglial depletion and repopulation via PLX5622 during the acute phase post stroke facilitate the recovery of neurological function. This immunomodulatory strategy offers a promising and clinically translationally relevant approach to enhance functional recovery following ischemic brain injury.",

  "title": "A deadly equation: The global toll of US TB funding cuts",
  "description": "The recent withdrawal of U.S. financial support threatens essential TB service delivery, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions and research initiatives critical to eradicating TB. This study analyses the dependency of and potential impact of funding cuts to 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs). We modelled three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (long-term service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases between 2025 and 2030 are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45–0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2–2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85–13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,900 (CI 65,200–130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800–337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800–2,807,300), respectively. The loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control efforts, jeopardizing progress towards End TB and SDG targets, and potentially puts millions of lives at risk. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain critical TB prevention and treatment efforts.",

  "title": "The lipocone superfamily, a unifying theme in metabolism of lipids, peptidoglycan and exopolysaccharides, inter-organismal conflicts and immunity",
  "description": "Wnt proteins are critical signaling molecules in developmental processes across animals. Despite intense study, their evolutionary roots have remained enigmatic. Using sensitive sequence analysis and structure modeling, we establish that the Wnts are part of a vast assemblage of domains, the Lipocone superfamily, defined here for the first time. It includes previously studied enzymatic domains like the phosphatidylserine synthases (PTDSS1/2) and the TelC toxin domain from Streptococcus intermedius, the enigmatic VanZ proteins, the animal Serum Amyloid A (SAA), and a further host of uncharacterized proteins in a total of 30 families. Although the metazoan Wnts are catalytically inactive, we present evidence for a conserved active site across this superfamily, versions of which are consistently predicted to operate on head groups of either phospholipids or polyisoprenoid lipids, catalyzing transesterification and phosphate-containing head group cleavage reactions. We argue that this superfamily originated as membrane proteins, with one branch (including Wnt and SAA) evolving into diffusible versions. By comprehensively analyzing contextual information networks derived from comparative genomics, we establish that they act in varied functional contexts, including regulation of membrane lipid composition, extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis, and biogenesis of bacterial outer-membrane components, like lipopolysaccharides. On multiple occasions, members of this superfamily, including the bacterial progenitors of Wnt and SAA, have been recruited as effectors in biological conflicts spanning inter-organismal interactions and anti-viral immunity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These findings establish a unifying theme in lipid biochemistry, explain the origins of Wnt signaling, and provide new leads regarding immunity across the tree of life.",

  "title": "Induction of an early IFN-γ cellular response and high plasma levels of SDF-1α are inversely associated with COVID-19 severity and residence in rural areas in Kenyan patients",
  "description": "IntroductionCOVID-19 was less severe in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) compared with Europe and North America. It is unclear whether these differences could be explained immunologically. Here we determined levels of ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 peptide-specific IFN-γ producing cells, and plasma cytokines and chemokines over the first month of COVID-19 diagnosis among Kenyan COVID-19 patients from urban and rural areas.MethodsBetween June 2020 and August 2022, we recruited and longitudinally monitored 188 COVID-19 patients from two regions in Kenya, Nairobi (urban, n = 152) and Kilifi (rural, n = 36), with varying disease severity – severe, mild/moderate, and asymptomatic. IFN-γ secreting cells were enumerated at 0-, 7-, 14- and 28-days post diagnosis by an ex vivo enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay following in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with overlapping peptides from several SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A multiplexed binding assay was used to measure levels of 22 plasma cytokines and chemokines.ResultsHigher frequencies of IFN-γ-secreting cells against SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides were observed on the day of diagnosis among asymptomatic compared to patients with severe COVID-19. Higher concentrations of 17 of the 22 cytokines and chemokines measured were positively associated with severe disease, particularly interleukin (IL)-8, IL-18 and IL-1ra (p < 0.0001), while a lower concentration of SDF-1α was associated with severe disease (p < 0.0001). Concentrations of 8 and 16 cytokines and chemokines including IL-18 were higher among Nairobi asymptomatic and mild patients compared to their respective Kilifi counterparts. Conversely, concentrations for SDF-1α were higher in rural Kilifi compared to Nairobi (p = 0.012).ConclusionIn Kenya, as seen elsewhere, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were associated with severe COVID-19, while an early IFN-γ cellular response to overlapping SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides was associated with reduced risk of disease. Living in urban Nairobi (compared with rural Kilifi) was associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.",

  "title": "Micro‐Embolic Events and Their Clearing in the Brain. A Narrative Review",
  "description": "ABSTRACTBackgroundThe cerebral circulation is continuously challenged by intravascular micrometer‐sized particles that become trapped microvascular‐emboli. These particles may include micro‐thrombi, stiffened erythrocytes, and leukocytes, while also fat particles, air, and microplastics may cause microvascular embolism.Review ScopeIn this narrative review, we discuss these embolization processes and their acute and chronic consequences. These relate to the local flow interruption as well as the direct interaction with the endothelium. In addition, we address the clearing processes, including local thrombolysis and extravasation, or angiophagy, of the emboli.ConclusionA continuous balance exists between embolic events and their resolution under normal conditions. Increased micro‐embolic rates, as occur in e.g., atrial fibrillation, or decreased clearing, possibly related to endothelial cell dysfunction, disturb this balance. This could lead to continuing loss of capillaries, micro‐infarcts, and cognitive decline.",

  "title": "Mechanotransduction mechanisms in human erythrocytes: Fundamental physiology and clinical significance",
  "description": "ABSTRACTThe hallmarks of mechanosensitive ion channels have been observed for half a century in various cell lines, although their mechanisms and molecular identities remained unknown until recently. Identification of the bona fide mammalian mechanosensory Piezo channels resulted in an explosion of research exploring the translation of mechanical cues into biochemical signals and dynamic cell morphology responses. One of the Piezo isoforms – Piezo1 – is integral in the erythrocyte (red blood cell; RBC) membrane. The exceptional flexibility of RBCs and the absence of intracellular organelles provides a unique mechanical and biochemical environment dictating specific Piezo1-functionality. The Piezo1-endowed capacity of RBCs to sense the mechanical forces acting upon them during their continuous traversal of the circulatory system has solidified a brewing step-change in our fundamental understanding of RBC biology in health and disease; that is, RBCs are not biologically inert but rather capable of complex dynamic cellular signaling. Although several lines of investigation have unearthed various regulatory mechanisms of signaling pathway activation by RBC-Piezo1, these independent studies have not yet been synthesized into a cohesive picture. The aim of the present review is to thus summarize the progress in elucidating how Piezo1 functions in the unique cellular environment of RBCs, challenge classical views of this enucleated cell, and provoke developments for future work.",

  "title": "The role of Moringa oleifera in enhancing fish performance and health: a comprehensive review of sustainable aquaculture applications",
  "description": "This comprehensive review examines the versatile applications and effects of Moringa oleifera across multiple fish species in aquaculture systems amid growing challenges of rising feed costs and antimicrobial resistance. M. oleifera, commonly called the Miracle tree, contains an exceptional nutritional profile with high protein content (22.99–29.36% dry weight), complete profiles of essential amino acids, and remarkably elevated levels of vitamins and minerals. Its bioactive profile includes substantial quantities of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids (niazimicin, niaziminin, β-sitosterol), and glucosinolates that collectively enhance fish health and performance. Recent studies across multiple fish species demonstrate variable optimal inclusion rates (5–30%) with specific growth rates increasing 15–35% and feed conversion ratios improving 10–25% compared to controls. Physiological benefits include enhanced digestive enzyme activity, improved liver and kidney functions, and reduced cortisol levels during environmental stress. Immunologically, M. oleifera supplementation significantly increases lysozyme activity, complement C3, total IgM levels, and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNFα, IL1-β, IL-6), strengthening resistance against major aquaculture pathogens including Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio species. Challenge studies demonstrate relative percent survival improvements ranging from 48 to 73% against virulent pathogens. Haematological improvements include increased erythrocyte counts, higher haemoglobin levels at moderate inclusion rates, and beneficial effects on glucose metabolism and lipid profiles. Moringa seeds are highly effective natural water clarifiers, removing 95–99% of turbidity through cationic proteins that act as coagulants. However, their antinutritional compounds (tannins, phytates, saponins, oxalates) can harm fish at elevated levels, requiring careful dosage monitoring in aquaculture applications. This review synthesizes current evidence, identifies optimal application strategies, and provides direction for future research to maximize Moringa’s potential as a sustainable, cost-effective resource for enhancing productivity, fish health, and environmental sustainability in modern aquaculture systems.",

  "title": "Inequalities in effective coverage of the maternal healthcare continuum in Cameroon: a cascade analysis from service contact to input-adjusted coverage",
  "description": "BackgroundMaternal healthcare (MHC) in Cameroon reflects the persistent challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa, where high maternal mortality continues despite improved service utilization, stressing inequitable effective coverage (EC). This study applied EC cascade analysis—including service contact, continuity, and input-adjusted coverage—to quantify geographic and socioeconomic disparities, informing equity-focused strategies to dismantle structural barriers in the MHC continuum.MethodsWe combined population and health facility data (2018 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey and 2015 Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care Assessment) to estimate the input-adjusted coverage of antenatal care (ANC) and intra-and postpartum care (IPC). Inequalities were assessed using absolute and relative measures.ResultsThe MHC cascade showed significant falls in input-adjusted coverage. For ANC, 86.3% service contact eroded to 25.3% continuity and 14.4% input-adjusted coverage. For IPC, the service continuum dropped from 51.4 to 31.4% input-adjusted coverage, revealing steeper losses compared to ANC (20.0% vs. 10.9%). When accounting for service readiness, relative inequalities intensified (e.g., the wealth-based RII for ANC increased by 122%), while absolute gaps narrowed (SII declined by 25%), indicating a greater loss of coverage among socioeconomically privileged groups (IPC input-adjusted coverage dropped by 20.9% for the highest quintile vs. 11.1% for the lowest quintile). At the same time, marginalized populations experienced compounded exclusion—facing severely limited access to care and substandard service quality at available facilities—highlighting the critical need to improve both access and quality.ConclusionCameroon’s MHC disparities stem from systemic resource and quality gaps. Integrating absolute and relative inequality metrics into policy frameworks can dismantle structural biases, aligning interventions with continuum-of-care strategies to prevent avoidable mortality.",

    "bodyText": "Zimbabwe’s efforts to control malaria have been dealt a huge blow as experts say the disease has returned “with a vengeance” after US aid cuts, with 115 outbreaks recorded in 2025 compared with only one last year. The sharp rise in cases comes six months after Donald Trump halted critical funding for US research and national response programmes. The cuts in January, which included funding for tuberculosis, HIV/Aids and malaria programmes, crippled the Zimbabwe Entomological Support Programme in Malaria (Zento) at Africa University in Mutare, which provides the country’s National Malaria Control Programme with scientific research to combat the disease. Cumulative malaria cases increased by 180% in the first four months of 2025, according to the health ministry, while the number of malaria-related deaths increased by 218%, from 45 in the same period in 2024 to 143 in 2025. As of 26 June, the number of malaria cases had risen to 119,648, with 334 deaths, according to the Zimbabwean health ministry. The distribution of essential control methods, such as mosquito nets, was also disrupted, leaving hundreds of thousands of people exposed to mosquito bites across the country. The health ministry said in May that 1,615,000 insecticide-treated nets were being distributed but that there was a shortfall of 600,000 due to the withdrawal of US funding. Itai Rusike, director of Zimbabwe’s Community Working Group on Health, said funding shortfalls were jeopardising the country’s significant gains against malaria over the past 20 years. “Sustained domestic funding is critical to keep prevention and treatment efforts on track,” he said. “If mosquito nets and preventive medicines for pregnant women are unavailable, lives will be lost. When the supply of test kits and first-line treatments is disrupted, malaria cases and deaths will spiral.” Children under the age of five account for 14% of total malaria cases. Zimbabwe has set out to eliminate malaria by 2030, in line with the ambitious goal set by the African Union, using various strategies such as raising community awareness, preventing mosquito bites with insecticide-treated nets and spraying, as well as improving surveillance systems. Dr Henry Madzorera, a former health minister, said Zimbabwe should mobilise its own resources to bridge the funding gap. “We have a lot of taxes earmarked for the health sector – let us use them wisely for health promotion and disease prevention,” he said. “People must be treated early for malaria. “The country should not rely on donors to do malaria-elimination activities,” Madzorera added. In 2024, USAID disbursed $270m for health and agriculture programmes in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe’s deputy health minister, Sleiman Kwidini, admitted the funding gap left by the US cuts had disrupted the provision of mosquito nets. “We are now taking over the procurement of those nets after the US withdrew funding. We have just been disturbed, but our vision is to eliminate malaria by 2030,” he said. Prof Sungano Mharakurwa, director of Africa University’s Malaria Institute, said it would take time to recover lost ground but added: “If we get funding, we can hit the ground running and promptly return to scoring successes again, until we beat this deadly scourge that is malaria.” He said that since the Zento mosquito surveillance programme began in Manicaland province, there had been a marked reduction in malaria cases and it was about to be extended when the US cuts came. “Working with the National Malaria Control Programme, it had just been expanded,” Mharakurwa said. “It was poised to run for five years with national coverage when it was abruptly terminated.” Africa University data shows that Manicaland recorded 145,775 malaria cases in 2020 but just 28,387 after Zento was introduced in 2021. Malaria cases in the province had been further reduced to 8,035 by 2024 before more than trebling to 27,212 the following year, when US funding was cut. Mharakurwa said: “The malaria was back with a vengeance straight after, and [numbers of] cases that were waning rebounded in 2025, surpassing levels that had ever been seen since the beginning of the project.” Above-normal rains this year, which aided malaria transmission, had worsened the situation, he added."

    "bodyText": "A flagship programme to create malaria vaccines has been halted by the Trump administration, in just one example of a rippling disruption to health research around the globe since the new US president took power. The USAid Malaria Vaccine Development Program (MVDP) – which works to prevent child deaths by creating more effective second-generation vaccines – funds research by teams collaborating across institutes, including the US university Johns Hopkins and the UK’s University of Oxford. Earlier this week, it told partners to stop work, after the president and his allies ordered a freeze on US spending. Researchers warned that the impact of the abrupt halt on other programmes could fuel the spread of drug-resistant HIV, and put medical progress back by years. The MVDP’s aim is “to reduce the impact of malaria on children living in malaria-endemic areas of the world”. In sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 450,000 under-5s are killed by malaria each year. While the introduction of two malaria vaccines in 2024 was hailed as transformative, MVDP-funded research aims to make them much more effective and longer-lasting. A senior academic who has been involved with the programme for a number of years said the sudden halt would set back research, and was likely to include ongoing trials in humans and animals. They said MVDP-funded projects were often testing a new vaccine in humans for the first time, meaning “huge safety implications of suddenly shutting down – you are absolutely obliged to follow [participants] up and make sure they stay safe.” The USAid funding freeze and stop or suspend work orders cover an initial period of 90 days while a review is carried out, according to official statements. However, multiple sources in the health research field said they were unclear who would have the expertise to carry out such a review, with many senior officials at US health bodies having been fired. Tom Drake, senior policy analyst at the Center for Global Development, said that the impact of cuts to research funding were less visible and less immediate than the implications for the provision of life-saving programmes around the world “but is no less real”. “The advent of malaria vaccines is one of the greatest global health achievements of our time, and is a direct result of funding by the MVDP and many others,” he said. “Even if other funders step in to plug the gaps in malaria vaccine funding, there is always an opportunity cost, and so some other development research issue will be neglected as a result.” Prof Kelly Chibale of the H3D research centre at the University of Cape Town said a project working to create a platform to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients necessary for antiretrovirals in South Africa was at risk. “We are urgently looking for alternative funding mechanisms to continue this important work, retain the team members and ensure the sustainability of the platform,” he said. “The project will also suffer if our collaborators in the US lose staff in this period of uncertainty.” Prof Kenneth Ngure of the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology in Kenya and president-elect of the International Aids Society, said researchers on projects testing HIV prevention options such as injectable drugs and vaginal rings globally had received stop work orders. Even if projects are reinstated after a 90-day pause, there will still be “a lot of damage”, he said. “It’s like you’re having a car speeding on a highway. Then you apply emergency brakes. There are so many things that can go wrong,” he said. “I’ve been doing HIV prevention research for the last 20 years; nothing like this has happened. The thing that came closest to this was Covid, and when Covid came, we were able to [find] other ways of continuing with our programmes.” Some products, such as injectable HIV prevention drugs, are not yet available outside research settings, he said, leaving participants with no alternative source to continue treatment. If the level of drugs in a participant’s body falls to nonprotective levels, it not only puts them at risk of infection, but means their infection is more likely to develop drug resistance. That makes their treatment more complicated, and if they then infect someone else, the resistance will spread. Projects that had recently been completed and were ready for data analysis had been affected, Ngure said. “Human beings have given their time. It’s also an ethical obligation for you. When you have done a study, you need to finish that study and you need to share the findings.” He said: “There’s need for reconsideration of this decision. We’ve had huge support from the US government, many infections have been averted, and we are now starting to talk about controlling the HIV pandemic in the coming years. But when you’ve done all this, if you then stop, we start going backwards. And we can go backwards for many years, if not decades.” Approached for comment, a state department spokesperson referred to a waiver issued on Wednesday for life-saving humanitarian assistance."

    "bodyText": "In an unassuming building on an industrial estate outside Oxford, Michal Bilski sits in a windowless room with electric fly swatters and sticky tape on the wall, peering down a microscope. On the slide before him is a line of mosquito eggs that he collected less than an hour previously and put into position with a brush. Bilski manoeuvres a small needle filled with a DNA concoction and uses it to pierce each egg and inject a tiny amount. “Each slide has between 50 and 100 eggs on it, and it takes from 15 minutes to half an hour to inject them all,” he says. “Normally in a day we would inject between 500 to over 1,000 eggs.” Bilski, a research and development team leader for the biotechnology company Oxitec, is carrying out one of the early stages in the process of making genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes. It is hoped the insects that hatch will prove instrumental in the fight against diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika and chikungunya of which mosquitoes are vectors. Last year, Oxitec released tens of thousands of GM mosquitoes in Djibouti, where there has been a resurgence of malaria caused by an invasive species. It was the first time such mosquitoes have been released in east Africa and the second time on the continent. It follows multiple releases of modified mosquitoes in Florida and Brazil to combat dengue fever, a neglected tropical disease. The impact of these mosquitoes on malaria transmission could be significant, believes Lottie Renwick, head of strategy for Malaria No More UK. “They will play a really major role and be gamechanging,” she says, but adds that the intervention needs to work alongside other tools such as mosquito nets and injections. Malaria is transmitted by female mosquitoes and is one of the biggest killers of children under five. According to the World Health Organization, in 2023 there were an estimated 263m cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths in 83 countries. Africa bears the greatest burden (94% of cases) and children under five accounted for more than three-quarters (76%) of all malaria deaths. Djibouti, an east African country of a million people, had been close to eliminating the disease, but cases jumped from just 27 in 2012 to more than 73,000 in 2020. The cause was a species of mosquito that came from south Asia and the Arabian peninsula into Africa. The Anopheles stephensi mosquito has since been detected in Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia and Kenya, as well as Nigeria and Ghana in west Africa. According to one study, if this mosquito is left unchecked an additional 126 million people on the continent will be at risk of malaria. It is a big threat because it thrives in urban environments, unlike other malaria-carrying mosquitoes in Africa that primarily breed in rural areas. Cities in Africa are growing rapidly, with more than half of Africans predicted to be urban dwellers by 2035. Anopheles stephensi has also been found to be resistant to many of the insecticides used to control mosquito populations. They bite in the evening before most people’s bedtime – not in the middle of the night like other mosquitoes – making bed nets less effective as protection. The government of Djibouti – aware of the work to develop and deploy GM mosquitoes to fight invasive species that spread dengue fever in Brazil – has partnered with Oxitec to tackle the threat. In the laboratory, once every egg has been injected with the DNA, they are taken to a warm and humid room in which the conditions are ripe for them to mature into adults. White shelves line the walls; on one side of the room are trays of water with mosquito larvae in them, while on the adjacent wall are plastic boxes filled with fully grown insects. One box has a contraption containing blood on top for the female mosquitoes to feed on. Inside the box the mosquitoes’ bottoms are pointing up, a sign that these insects carry the parasite that causes malaria. It takes four or five days for the 5-30% of the eggs that usually survive the injection to hatch into larvae. In total, an egg typically takes about 14 days to develop into an adult mosquito. In another room a few doors down, Anna Schoenauer, a team leader, is also glued to a microscope. When she shines blue light on the slide, a group of mosquitoes, magnified on a screen, can be seen wriggling around, glowing fluorescent green. This is as a result of a marker that they were injected with alongside the DNA, to signify whether they are carrying the altered gene. The lab-produced mosquitoes carry a “self-limiting” gene that blocks normal cellular processes, which means if they mate, any female offspring will die. The male progeny, which do not bite, will survive and go on to mate with other wild females. With sustained releases of these “friendly mosquitoes”, more females die off, greatly reducing the mosquito population and the spread of malaria. Scientists at Oxitec and malaria and mosquito experts insist these mosquitoes are safe. After evaluating the risk, the US Food and Drug Administration in 2016 and the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2022 confirmed that the mosquitoes did not pose a threat to humans or the environment. There are no results published yet from the work going on in Djibouti, and Grey Frandsen, chief executive officer at Oxitec, acknowledges that much work remains to be done. “We’re working on the invasive species but there are multiple species that transmit malaria,” he says. “There is no silver bullet in the malaria fight.” Currently, most of the funding going into technologies such as this comes from international donors and philanthropists. With the Trump administration’s shutdown of USAID, the landscape for international humanitarian work has changed, but Frandsen is undeterred. “We recognise what’s happening, and the impact it might be having on the international health community, but this is our time to shine,” he says. “This is when disruptive tools are needed the most. This is where new technologies have to now play a more important role than ever.”"

    "bodyText": "Ten patients suffering from a mystery disease that has broken out in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have tested positive for malaria, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said. However, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the patients could have more than one disease simultaneously. “Of the 12 initial samples collected, 10 tested positive for malaria, although it’s possible that more than one disease is involved. Further samples will be collected and tested to determine the exact cause or causes,” a WHO spokesperson said on Tuesday. Cases of unidentified illness in a remote part of the DRC have caused alarm, with specialist teams from the WHO and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention sent to investigate. Those investigations are continuing. The DRC’s health minister said last week that the disease had killed 79 people in the Panzi health zone since 24 October, with 376 cases identified. Most were children under five. The main symptoms are similar to flu, with patients experiencing headaches, coughing, difficulty breathing and anaemia. At a briefing on 5 December, Dieudonne Mwamba, the head of the DRC’s National Institute for Public Health, said the symptoms pointed to a respiratory illness, but without a clear diagnosis it was hard to know the cause, and whether it was a virus or bacteria. He said the affected area was “fragile”, with 40% of people there experiencing malnutrition. The DRC is also dealing with an mpox outbreak and seasonal flu. There is little testing capacity, and samples from patients have been transported to a regional laboratory in Kikwit, 300 miles away, as well as the national reference laboratory in Kinshasa, more than 400 miles away, a journey of two days by road. Amid speculation that the outbreak could represent “Disease X” – a term used to describe a previously unknown pathogen with the potential to cause a pandemic – the WHO emphasised it was “an undiagnosed disease rather than an unknown” one. Officials said a respiratory pathogen such as flu or Covid-19 was being investigated as a possible cause, as well as malaria, measles and others. In an update on Sunday, the WHO said the affected area “experienced deterioration in food insecurity in recent months, has low vaccination coverage and very limited access to diagnostics and quality case management”. It said there was also a shortage of health staff, supplies and transportation, with “very limited” malaria control measures."

    "bodyText": "A previously unidentified disease circulating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a severe form of malaria, the country’s health ministry has said. Earlier this month, local authorities said the disease had killed 143 people in the south-west Kwango province in November. The symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, cough, runny nose and body aches. “The mystery has finally been solved. It’s a case of severe malaria in the form of a respiratory illness,” the health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that malnutrition in the area had weakened the local population, leaving them more vulnerable to disease. The statement said 592 cases had been reported since October, with a fatality rate of 6.2%. Reports of an unknown disease had sparked alarm, and prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to send a team of investigators to the remote part of the DRC. However, officials had stressed there were high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition in the area that were likely to exacerbate the impact of known illnesses, including malaria. The WHO also pointed to “low vaccination coverage and very limited access to diagnostics and quality case management”. Malaria still kills almost 600,000 people a year globally, and 12% of those deaths occur in the DRC. The provincial health minister, Apollinaire Yumba, told Reuters that anti-malaria medicine provided by the WHO was being distributed in the main hospital and health centres in the Panzi health zone. A WHO spokesperson said more health kits for moderate and critical cases were due to arrive on Wednesday. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said last week that 10 early samples from patients in DRC suffering from a mystery illness had tested positive for malaria, but that he had not ruled out the possibility that they had other concurrent diseases."

    "bodyText": "Malaria killed almost 600,000 people in 2023, as cases rose for the fifth consecutive year, according to a new report from the World Health Organization (WHO). Biological threats such as rising resistance to drugs and insecticides, and climate and humanitarian disasters continue to hamper control efforts, world health leaders warned. Globally, there were 263m cases last year, 11m more than the previous year; the vast majority (94%) occurred in Africa. Officials said a $4.3bn (£3.4bn) annual funding shortfall was among further challenges, which also include the spread of a new insecticide-resistant species of mosquito, genetic mutations in the malaria parasite that stop tests working, and the emergence of a new type of malaria parasite in south-east Asia. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said: “No one should die of malaria; yet the disease continues to disproportionately harm people living in the African region, especially young children and pregnant women.” There was now “an expanded package of life-saving tools” that protected against the disease, he said, but a need for more investment and action in the African countries with the highest rates. About $4bn went into fighting malaria globally last year, less than half of the $8.3bn that official control plans consider necessary. That has meant gaps in the provision of tools such as medicines and insecticide-treated bed nets, with the most vulnerable groups often missing out, said the report. Only half of those at risk of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa slept under insecticide-treated nets, and only 45% of pregnant women in the region had the recommended three doses of preventive malaria therapy. About 80 million people in countries where malaria is found are refugees or internally displaced, making it harder for them to access prevention and treatment services. Meanwhile, the climate crisis is increasing rates of extreme weather events that cause flooding, creating breeding grounds for mosquitoes and disrupting access to healthcare in countries such as Pakistan and Madagascar, the report said. Earlier this month British health officials warned that they were seeing rising numbers of malaria cases in travellers returning to the UK. In 2023, there were 2,106 cases of imported malaria, up 26% on the 1,555 reported in 2022. Six people died from the illness. Provisional figures recorded 753 cases in the first half of 2024. A separate report published last month by the Malaria Atlas Project and Boston Consulting Group, with funding from the Gates Foundation, predicts that Africa will see more than 550,000 additional deaths from malaria in Africa between 2030 and 2049 due to extreme weather events such as floods and cyclones. Resistance to drugs that have been the gold-standard treatment for malaria is spreading, the report said, and mosquitoes are increasingly resistant to the insecticides used to treat bed nets. However, the report included grounds for optimism, including the introduction in 17 countries so far of malaria vaccines for young children that have cut death rates by 13%. And the development of new bed nets made more effective by using more than one type of insecticide to combat resistance accounted for 78% of nets delivered to sub-Saharan Africa last year. The WHO has certified 44 countries and one territory to be free of malaria, including Egypt in October. There are 83 countries where malaria is considered endemic and 25 of those now report fewer than 10 cases a year. • This article includes mention of funding for malaria research by the Gates Foundation.

    "bodyText": "For the hundreds of children who arrive every day at hospitals in parts of Africa unconscious and unresponsive, their survival chances have remained unchanged for nearly 50 years. But new research ihas suggested that a different – and simpler – approach could improve those chances. Despite huge strides in healthcare and vaccination rates for children in sub Saharan Africa, the odds remain poor for those who become so ill they fall into a coma. Depending on the cause, between 17% and 45% are expected to die. Many more will be left with disabilities. “It can become depressing,” says Dr Alice Muiruri-Liomba, who works in Blantyre, Malawi. Now researchers have found that giving antibiotics immediately a child arrives at hospital could save tens of thousands of lives a year – and getting them to specialist care quickly could also reduce deaths and disability. An analysis of multiple studies published in the Lancet Global Health shows that most of these children have a complication of malaria, called cerebral malaria. The second most common identified cause is bacterial meningitis. A second study by the same team, focusing on Queen Elizabeth hospital in Blantyre, found that one in four children hospitalised in a coma with malaria also had bacterial infection. “Too often, malaria parasites found in the blood of a sick African child stop medical staff looking for and treating additional bacterial infections,” says Dr Stephen Ray of the Oxford Vaccine Group, the study’s principal investigator. “You treat the malarial parasites as the cause of the coma, and then actually that becomes a risk factor for dying from a bacterial underlying infection that has been untreated … we need to just make sure everyone that comes in with febrile coma gets antibiotics, as well as antimalarials.” Making that standard practice could change how 2.3 million children a year in Africa are treated and save more than 20,000 lives, Ray says. Data is patchy, but studies and doctors’ observations suggest non-traumatic coma is much more common among children in sub-Saharan Africa than it is in the global north. “A child comes in, unfortunately, quite a lot later down the line than they would in a UK setting,” says Ray. That can mean “at up to a day, or over a day, of full, deep coma. Completely unconscious, unable to communicate, completely disoriented, with a very high fever.” Those symptoms would prompt a UK ambulance “within minutes”. In Malawi, it can take days. “That delay is catastrophic – we showed with brain scans, by the time they get to you, they’ve actually got quite a lot of neurological complications: brain swelling, brain injury,” says Ray. Muiruri-Liomba says transport is an issue for families. “We have cases where you have a mother carrying a convulsing child on her back the whole night, walking to a health facility. Then they get there, and in this health facility you don’t have ambulances … so these mothers are forced to go and source their own transport to a bigger hospital.” Muiruri-Liomba works at Queen Elizabeth central hospital – which is relatively well resourced, boasting the country’s only portable MRI scanner. . District hospitals can be poorly equipped with medicine shortages and basic facilities. Children will usually have been treated at home, then at a clinic and a district hospital before reaching Queen Elizabeth, Muiruri-Liomba says. “We only take patients to the hospital once they complicate – and what that tells me is that they don’t understand the danger of what malaria is capable of doing, or what a febrile illness leading to seizures and coma is capable of doing.” Muiruri-Liomba wants to raise awareness both in the community and among health professionals. “Those children who present late are likely to have a bad outcome,” she stresses, which could be death or brain damage, probably caused by seizures that have not been managed at an earlier stage. Dr Tarun Dua, who leads the Brain Health Unit at the World Health Organization (WHO), agrees that “systemic challenges or barriers that we see in access to care and delivery” is a key problem. “In many of the countries in Africa, there is only one child neurologist per 4 million population,” she says. “If you think about where neuroimaging is available, it is in the capital or a couple of cities. There is a big rural/urban divide.” WHO guidelines on meningitis care, updated in April, say children with suspected acute meningitis “need to start empiric antibiotics” before tests. “Our task is, how do we get countries to implement those guidelines?” says Dua. She is hopeful of technological advances. Low-cost brain scans and better bedside tests are in development. “Things are moving,” she says. “But I think accelerated action is important.”"

    "bodyText": "Mosquitoes carry some of the world’s deadliest diseases, including malaria, yellow fever and dengue. But challenging geography, conflict, budgets and insecticide resistance are among the issues hampering efforts to fight them. With global malaria cases continuing to rise and the climate crisis hastening the spread of virus-carrying mosquitoes into more countries, scientists are searching for low-cost, equitable ways to stop them transmitting disease. Could harnessing gene drive – a process that can rapidly spread a genetic modification – be the answer? What is gene drive? “Gene drive is simply a mechanism that enables a gene to spread itself through a population,” says Prof Luke Alphey, chair in genetics at the University of York. “When it becomes important is when we use it to spread a trait that is useful to humans.” Under normal genetic rules, animals have a 50:50 chance of inheriting a single gene from either parent. But a gene drive is a naturally occurring process where a specific gene is prioritised, meaning its chances of being inherited are up to 99%. Within a few generations, almost all of the species will carry that gene. Scientists have studied this process for decades but have only recently developed ways to artificially replicate it in the lab. Now they hope to use it to spread genetic modifications through animal populations – such as mosquitoes – to help reduce their numbers or stop them transmitting disease. In broad terms, genetic modification is where scientists make changes to certain genetic characteristics, such as the ability of mosquitoes to carry the malaria-causing parasite. Whereas in an (artificial) gene drive, scientists alter the way genes are passed between generations to prioritise the spread of a certain gene. By pairing these processes, scientists can spread desired genetic modifications – potentially throughout an entire species. Dr Nikolai Windbichler, a geneticist at Imperial College London, describes it as a way of “genetically engineering entire populations”, rather than individuals. Why does it matter? Malaria is transmitted through the bites of the female Anopheles mosquito, which is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa. While the Aedes species (the yellow fever mosquito), lives across the Americas, Africa and Asia and spreads other serious viruses, including dengue, yellow fever and Zika – of which there have been outbreaks in the past decade, particularly in South America. The climate emergency is pushing disease-carrying mosquitoes further afield, with the first mosquito-transmitted Zika case in Europe recorded in 2019, and global malaria cases have risen since the Covid pandemic after two decades of gradual decline. In 2023, there were 263m cases, 11m more than the previous year – and 600,000 deaths, three-quarters of them in children under five. More than 1,200 children a day are dying from malaria. Dr John Connolly, senior regulatory science officer at research group Target Malaria, says: “The tools we developed 10 to 20 years ago – particularly insecticide-treated bed nets – have been really effective in reducing [malaria] prevalence and deaths but the improvements we have seen have stalled.” As well as developing insecticide resistance, mosquitoes are also adapting to bite other than at night-time. Anti-malaria campaigns are limited by human willingness to comply with bed nets and vaccinations, and broader problems such as challenging geography, conflict, fluctuating government priorities and funding issues. “There’s a need to identify innovative tools to integrate into our approach to deal with these factors,” Connolly says. Rather than replacing existing tools, scientists hope gene drives will add to the toolkit in the fight against mosquito-borne disease. And, unlike most other interventions, its effects would be felt equally because it targets mosquitoes rather than relying on human action. How are gene drives being used? Different research teams are exploring unique ways of using gene drives, although they all have the ultimate aim of reducing disease burden. The Target Malaria project, for example, is focused on population suppression. The partnership between Imperial College London and teams in Italy, US, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Uganda hopes to use a gene drive to spread a genetic modification that makes female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes infertile. Lab-based tests on 1,000 mosquitoes in 5-cubic-metre cages found the gene drive effectively spread the modified gene to most of the population within months (the lifecycle of a laboratory mosquito is about three weeks), leading to an increase in the number of sterile females which caused the population to plummet. Transmission Zero, a separate Imperial project that works with the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania, is focusing on using a gene drive for population modification. Its aim is to reduce mosquitoes’ ability to transmit malaria without affecting their numbers. First, scientists modify mosquitoes so they cannot transmit the malaria-causing parasite (the “resistance”) and then they use gene drive (the “driver”) to spread this resistance through mosquito populations. The University of California Malaria Initiative (UCMI) is also exploring population modification in partnership with teams in Portugal and São Tomé and Príncipe, but using a mechanism where the genetic modification and gene drive are combined into one process. All three projects have received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is prioritising the eradication of malaria. Could it tackle diseases other than malaria? The Alphey Lab at York University is researching using gene drive to limit the ability of the Aedes aegypti mosquito to spread dengue and other viruses. The team are working on “local gene drives” which will spread a modification in a small target population, but not throughout an entire species. This is particularly important as Aedes aegypti is much more widespread than its malaria-carrying cousins. “We don’t always want to modify an entire species – it might be a species is invasive in one area but we want to preserve a native population elsewhere,” Alphey says. Local gene drives are technically more complex than species-wide examples because they require multiple different genetic components in order to both spread and limit the desired trait as needed, but the team expects to have a prototype ready for testing in the wild within 10 years. The Alphey Lab has also received Gates Foundation funding for gene drive research. Other research teams around the world are at earlier stages of exploring using gene drive to reduce populations of invasive species, such as the golden mussel, and agricultural pests such as mice. What are the risks? As with any groundbreaking genetic engineering technology, gene drives are controversial. A 2021 paper by Connolly’s team identified 46 potential harms – but he stresses few are likely to be serious or even possible. Concerns around its use include the unknown potential knock-on effects on the ecosystem of removing mosquitoes, or whether removing or modifying malaria-carrying species could cause other types, carrying other diseases, to thrive. “It is our responsibility to assess and analyse all the possible risks, using modelling and experiments if necessary, and we could only move towards a field trial once we are satisfied,” says Connolly, while stressing Target Malaria is focusing on just three species of mosquito out of about 3,500 that exist. Researchers have carried out large engagement programmes with officials and communities to address concerns, including in Burkina Faso, Uganda and Tanzania. Alphey believes local gene drives could help allay some fears around the unknown consequences as any impact would be short-lived and not spread throughout the species. “We are erring on the side of caution,” he says. What do critics say? A number of international organisations are critical of genetic modification technology and have campaigned to stop gene drive experiments. These include representatives at Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth in Europe and the US. Critics’ main concern is the risk of unintended consequences on wider ecosystems, especially given that gene drive is designed to spread quickly and may be uncontrollable. There are also concerns the technology could be exploited in future for commercial gain (for example, if it is developed to control agricultural pests), or even as a biological weapon. Some organisations are also critical of the dynamic between research groups, which are largely led by teams based in Europe and the US, and proposed test countries, which are currently all African nations. A paper by the African Centre for Biodiversity said interventions by global north projects meant people in Africa were “passive ‘recipients’ of externally imposed solutions”. There have been conflicting reports of local protests, as well as complaints that local consultations and information outreach have failed to achieve widespread understanding of the issues and fully-informed consent among affected communities, in countries like Burkina Faso. In 2020, the European Parliament adopted a motion ahead of the Cop15 biodiversity summit which included a call for a moratorium – an enforced pause – on any release of gene drive organisms. As yet, there is no regional or international regulation controlling gene drive research, its permitted uses or agreement over who is responsible if anything goes wrong. When are we likely to see gene drives used outside the lab? “The results we have in the lab are very compelling,” says Connolly. “But the real test is what happens to mosquitoes in the field – and then what happens to malaria rates as a result.” Target Malaria’s Burkina Faso team tested Africa’s first release of genetically modified mosquitoes (sterile males) in 2019. And last year, Transmission Zero’s partner, the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania, became the first African centre to create a generation of genetically modified mosquitoes. While neither involved a gene drive, these are essential steps if gene drive mosquitoes are ever to be released into the wild. Scientists hope to start experimental field trials within the next five years – but legal technicalities are impeding progress. As the technology is new, there are no existing processes for approving gene drive experiments. Before any can go ahead, research groups first have to work with each country to establish who will regulate the gene drive and approve its use. Although existing laws around the use of GM crops could form the basis for gene drive regulation, these typically state there should be no cross-border movement of any modified species without the agreement of the countries affected. “Mosquitoes don’t understand international borders so we need regional-level agreement in sub-Saharan Africa,” says Connolly. The African Union is understood to be considering the issue. As local gene drives require only local approval, it may prove quicker to roll out – but the technology is taking longer to develop. But no field tests of any kind will happen until communities and governments approve. “We are just developing a technology – whether countries decide to adopt or use it is beyond us,” says Prof George Christophides, Transmission Zero co-director. Windbichler adds: “Ultimately the question of when it will happen is not a technical question, it’s a political one.” • This article includes mention of funding for malaria research by the Gates Foundation.

    "bodyText": "Researchers have found “troubling” evidence for the first time that a lifesaving malaria drug is becoming less effective in young African children with serious infections. A study of children being treated in hospital for malaria in Uganda, presented at a major conference on Thursday, found signs of resistance to artemisinin in one patient in 10. Antimicrobial resistance, where pathogens such as parasites, bacteria and fungi develop ways to evade the drugs used to fight them, is a growing global concern. It is forecast to kill more than 39 million people by 2050. Children are the most vulnerable to malaria, with about 450,000 under-5s dying from the disease in sub-Saharan Africa each year. Of the 100 children studied, 11 showed partial resistance to the treatment. All were infected by malaria parasites carrying genetic mutations that have been linked to artemisinin resistance. Dr Chandy John, of Indiana University, who co-wrote the study with international colleagues, said: “This is the first study from Africa showing that children with malaria and clear signs of severe disease are experiencing at least partial resistance to artemisinin.” A further 10 of the children studied, who were thought to have been cured of infection, suffered a repeat attack from the same strain of malaria within a month. The results suggest that the “gold-standard” treatment they had received, combining artemisinin with a second malaria drug called lumefantrine, was not working as well as it should. John said the study was started after researchers noticed a slow response to treatment in some children who were already being monitored for a project on severe malaria in young patients. “The fact that we started seeing evidence of drug resistance before we even started specifically looking for it is a troubling sign,” John said. “We were further surprised that, after we turned our focus to resistance, we also ended up finding patients who had recurrence after we thought they had been cured.” The study is being presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine &amp; Hygiene in New Orleans, and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. John said it was too early to determine how widespread resistance to artemisinin was in Africa, although there was evidence it was spreading, pointing to studies showing partial resistance in children with uncomplicated malaria – a milder form that does not affect organs – in countries such as Rwanda and Uganda. However, he said: “I think our study is the ‘canary in the coalmine’ for children with severe malaria.” Resistance to artemisinin therapies emerged earlier in south-east Asia, where the first signs were identified in similar studies. Treatment failure rates in that region increased when resistance also emerged to drugs used in combination with artemisinin. Dr Richard Pearson, of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, who was not involved in this study, said the situation in east Africa was reminiscent of the situation in south-east Asia 15 years ago. Artemisinin is used in a variety of forms to treat the disease. For children with severe malaria, this consists of an intravenous infusion of artesunate, one derivative of artemisinin, followed by an oral drug combining a second derivative with another antimalarial medicine. Artesunate replaced quinine as the recommended treatment for children with severe malaria more than a decade ago, after a trial showed fewer deaths with the newer drug. “Returning to quinine would be a step backward,” John said. Dr Alena Pance, a senior lecturer in genetics at the University of Hertfordshire, said any indication of resistance to the “critical drug” was extremely worrying and that high transmission rates in Africa “imposes a dangerous risk of quick spreading of resistance within the continent, making these findings even more alarming”."

    "bodyText": "By the age of six, Babirye Zainab had already contracted malaria several times. Her grandmother did not see it as a big problem though. “I would treat her with antimalarials and she would be all right,” she says. But then she developed a fever and started to have convulsions. Her urine was the colour of tea, and her grandmother, who shares the same name, was worried enough to take her on a motorbike to the local health centre. “We were discharged. A month later, she had another episode. Since then, she has experienced quite a number of episodes of passing tea-coloured urine,” she says. Zainab is part of a medical riddle affecting rural Uganda. She has blackwater fever, a rare but increasing complication of malaria that researchers are trying to explain. So named because patients’ urine turns dark with blood, it can be deadly. Blackwater fever happens when red blood cells break down, rapidly, in the bloodstream. They release haemoglobin and this is excreted in urine. It can result in anaemia and jaundice and require blood transfusion. Prof Kathryn Maitland of Imperial College London, based in Kenya, was part of a team that noticed high numbers of children in eastern Uganda with blackwater almost a decade ago. In a paper published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases they reported that the condition “according to local investigators, was rare until the last seven years” and speculated “that this might relate to the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapies”, the most modern type of antimalarial drugs. Since then, Maitland says, “we have been digging, digging, digging”, looking for an explanation. Historically, blackwater fever was seen among European expatriates who took small doses of quinine as an antimalarial, and became less common when other drugs took over. “It certainly wasn’t mentioned in the World Health Organization guidelines for severe malaria – it was recorded as a very rare occurrence. But it is increasing,” says Maitland. Her research team has looked at possible genetic causes including whether genes linked to sickle cell or G6PD enzyme deficiency, which raises the risk of red blood cells rupturing, might be involved. Neither seemed to be the answer. A theory that the drugs used for malaria in the affected part of Uganda might be substandard or fakes was debunked by thorough testing. “The drugs are good – so we’re back to the drawing board,” she says. The best hypothesis, she says, based on the experience of doctors in affected areas, remains a link to artemisinin-based malaria treatments. The presentation can be alarming, Maitland says. One child with blackwater fever was admitted to a hospital in the capital, Kampala. “They started to pass red and black urine. This was a time when there was Ebola around and it triggered an evacuation – all the mothers saw this, picked their kids up and ran out.” Affected children “have a high risk of dying”, she says. They may need multiple blood transfusions, raising the risk of an adverse reaction, and requiring hospitalisation. “What is very interesting in African children is that once they’ve had one episode, they tend to get it again and again,” she says. “Presumably every time they get reinfected with malaria parasites, they get blackwater fever.” Zainab experiences blackwater fever every few months, her grandmother says. Since turning eight, she has been out of school because of anaemia. “I often have to take her to the health facility due to her frail condition. She is out of school because of this,” says her grandmother, who has cared for her since she was six months old. “When she falls sick, I might even spend a week in the hospital.” Sometimes there are no drugs, and the family have to find private supplies. If Zainab needs a transfusion and there is no blood available locally, they have to travel to the regional hospital “which is very costly”. Zainab and her grandmother are now part of a research programme led by Jane Frances Zalwango of the Uganda National Institute of Public Health. She has a fellowship from a global healthcare company to track cases of blackwater fever in Uganda, and understand why some children develop the conditionand others do not. Uganda is still building its surveillance system, says Zalwango, meaning numbers are not comprehensive, but the data they do have on cases indicates a rise. The study has enrolled 400 children from Budaka district in eastern Uganda, where initial surveillance efforts recorded the highest numbers. Half have blackwater fever, while half have had malaria without developing the complication. They were followed for months, with blood samples taken to analyse immunological markers. Dr Mary Rodgers, an associate research fellow at global healthcare company Abbott, whose programme is part of the Training Programs in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network (Tephinet), said other theories under consideration included whether malaria in combination with a genetic factor, or “a co-infecting pathogen that might not otherwise make people sick” were involved. Speaking to families during trial enrolment was “really devastating”, Zalwango says. “They’re always worried about the next episode.” It had also revealed superstitions surrounding blackwater fever. “Some were not seeking help in time because of their traditional beliefs: thinking it’s maybe witchcraft or something. “But they are starting to get the hang of it due to their interaction with the health workers, educating them about seeking early healthcare to prevent any death from this episode, so we are getting better.” Zainab’s grandmother hopes the research will lead to treatment that can help her: “The health workers told me that it is malaria that causes this condition. However, Zainab was getting malaria before and not passing blood in urine. “Maybe they will find ways to prevent other children from developing the condition,” she says."
